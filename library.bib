abstract = {Facilities managers need to identify failure cause-effect patterns in order to prepare corrective and preventive maintenance plans. This task is difficult because of the complex interaction and interdependencies between different building components. Standardization based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides new opportunities to improve the efficiency of facilities management (FM) operations by sharing and exchanging building information between different applications throughout the lifecycle of the facilities. This paper aims to utilize BIM visualization capabilities to provide FM technicians with visualizations that allow them to utilize their cognitive and perceptual reasoning for problem solving. It investigates a knowledge-assisted BIM-based visual analytics approach for failure root-cause detection in FM. For this purpose, the inspection and maintenance data of Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) are integrated with a BIM. Moreover, various sources of building knowledge such as fault trees and relationships between components are formally represented. These resources are used to create custom visualizations through an interactive user interface which helps in exploiting the heuristic problem solving ability of field experts to find root causes of failures in a building. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {With the focus of smart construction project management, this paper presents a closed-loop digital twin framework under the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and data mining (DM) techniques. To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the high-fidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model. Consequently, tactic decision-making can realize to not only prevent possible failure in advance, but also arrange work and staffing reasonably to make the process adapt to changeable conditions. In short, the significance of this paper is to build a data-driven digital twin framework integrating with BIM, IoT, and data mining for advanced project management, which can facilitate data communication and exploration to better understand, predict, and optimize the physical construction operations. In future works, more complex cases with multiple data streams will be used to test the developed framework, and more detailed interpretations with the actual observations of construction activities will be given.},

abstract = {Projects in the construction industry typically involve complex information flows from early design, through construction, to facility management (FM). Building Information Modelling (BIM) tools and workflow processes are considered key enablers for collaboratively managing such information across phases of the project lifecycle. With the increased adoption of BIM by the construction industry, there are heightened expectations for increased engagement of facility managers (FMs), users and clients in the BIM process. This is based on the proposition that BIM can benefit the operational phase of a building, which contributes the most to the building lifecycle in terms of overall cost, sustainability and usability. The study aim was to investigate current levels of understanding and adoption of BIM by facility managers in practice. Three research questions were investigated: (a) How client and FM engagement with BIM workflows can be improved through early contemplation of their requirements; (b) what are the perceptions about BIM and its potential impact on the FM industry from an FM, user and client perspective and (c) what information is required by FM from the BIM process to maximum optimisation of assets in the operation phase. Mixed research methods, including: a literature review of academic and industry publications (e.g. case studies, industry best practice, standards and guidelines), an online survey of FM professionals and focus groups, were used to address the posed research questions. The findings highlight the need for further education regarding BIM guidelines and standards. In particular, new and more FM/client-focussed BIM strategy documents, EIR and other templates are required. Many existing templates (e.g. EIR) are not focused on client's needs. Guidance is required on developing BIM strategies based on understanding the client's Organisational Information Requirements (OIR) and Asset Information Requirements (AIR) in order to develop an EIR that specifies what, when and how information should be delivered. This will 2 improve timely decision making during design and ensure that the right and correctly structured information is delivered to clients at handover for their Asset Information Model (AIM) to help optimise the operation of their assets.

abstract = {Facility maintenance management (FMM) has become an important topic for research on the operation phase of the construction life cycle. Managing FMM effectively is extremely difficult owing to various factors and environments. One of the difficulties is the performance of 2D graphics when depicting maintenance service. Building information modeling (BIM) uses precise geometry and relevant data to support the maintenance service of facilities depicted in 3D object-oriented CAD. This paper proposes a new and practical methodology with application to FMM using BIM technology. Using BIM technology, this study proposes a BIM-based facility maintenance management (BIMFMM) system for maintenance staff in the operation and maintenance phase. The BIMFMM system is then applied in selected case study of a commercial building project in Taiwan to verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate its effectiveness in FMM practice. Using the BIMFMM system, maintenance staff can access and review 3D BIM models for updating related maintenance records in a digital format. Moreover, this study presents a generic system architecture and its implementation. The combined results demonstrate that a BIMFMM-like system can be an effective visual FMM tool. {\textcopyright} 2013 Yu-Cheng Lin and Yu-Chih Su.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore the current condition of the Big Data concept with its related barriers, drivers, opportunities and perceptions in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry with an emphasis on facilities management (FM). Design/methodology/approach: Following a comprehensive literature review, the Big Data concept was investigated through two scoping workshops with industry experts and academics. Findings: The value in data analytics and Big Data is perceived by the industry, yet the industry needs guidance and leadership. Also, the industry recognises the imbalance between data capturing and data analytics. Large IT vendors' developing AEC industry-focused analytics solutions and better interoperability among different vendors are needed. The general concerns for Big Data analytics mostly apply to the AEC industry as well. Additionally, however, the industry suffers from a structural fragmentation for data integration with many small-sized companies operating in its supply chains. This paper also identifies a number of drivers, challenges and way-forwards that calls for future actions for Big Data in FM in the AEC industry. Originality/value: The nature of data in the business world has dramatically changed over the past 20 years. This phenomenon is often broadly dubbed as “Big Data” with its distinctive characteristics, opportunities and challenges. Some industries have already started to effectively exploit “Big Data” in their business operations. However, despite many perceived benefits, the AEC industry has been slow in discussing and adopting the Big Data concept. Empirical research efforts investigating Big Data for the AEC industry are also scarce. This paper aims at outlining the benefits, challenges and future directions (what to do) for Big Data in the AEC industry with an FM focus.},

abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Semantic Web technologies are becoming more and more popular in the Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC) and Facilities Management (FM) industry to support information management, information exchange and data interoperability. One of the key integration gateways between BIM and SemanticWeb is represented by the ifcOWL ontology, i.e. the Web Ontology Language (OWL) version of the IFC standard, being one of reference technical standard for AEC/FM. Previous studies have shown how a recommended ifcOWL ontology can be automatically generated by converting the IFC standard from the official EXPRESS schema. However, the resulting ifcOWL is a large monolithic ontology that presents serious limitations for real industrial applications in terms of usability and performance (i.e. querying and reasoning). Possible enhancements to reduce the complexity and the data size consist in (1) modularization of ifcOWL making it easier to use subsets of the entire ontology, and (2) rethinking the contents and structure of an ontology for AEC/FM to better fit in the semantic web scope and make its usage more efficient. The second approach can be enabled by the first one, since it would make it easier to replace some of the ifcOWL modules with new optimized ontologies for the AEC-FM industry. This paper focuses on the first approach presenting a method to automatically generate a modular ifcOWL ontology. The method aims at minimizing the dependencies between modules to better exploit the modularization. The results are compared with simpler and more straight-forward solutions.},

However, BIM-based facility information from the construction phase is difficult to access and use during the operation and maintenance phase. This occurs because the BIM information is not utilized well in facility management (FM). In this research, we propose an approach to effectively manage BIM-based FM information by linking the BIM-based building elements and FM work information in an FM system database. We present a Semantic Web-based FM information system that semantically links BIM data to relevant historical work records. The proposed ontology was evaluated using a sample dataset of the architectural maintenance work records of an office building. Using the proposed approach, facility managers will be able to increase their efficiency in searching related work records that consider shared BIM objects by enhancing the interoperability and accessibility of FM data via the Semantic Web.},

abstract = {The widespread adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the recent emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) applications offer several new insights and decision-making capabilities throughout the life cycle of the built environment. In recent years, the ability of real-time connectivity to online sensors deployed in an environment has led to the emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin of the built environment. Digital Twins aim to achieve synchronization of the real world with a virtual platform for seamless management and control of the construction process, facility management, environment monitoring, and other life cycle processes in the built environment. However, research in Digital Twins for the built environment is still in its nascent stages and there is a need to understand the advances in the underlying enabling technologies and establish a convergent context for ongoing and future research. This paper conducted a systematic review to identify the development of the emerging technologies facilitating the evolution of BIM to Digital Twins in built environment applications. A total of 100 related papers including 23 review papers were selected and reviewed. In order to systematically classify the reviewed studies, the authors developed a five-level ladder categorization system based on the building life cycle to reflect the current state-of-the-art in Digital Twin applications. In each level of this taxonomy, applications were further categorized based on their research domains (e.g., construction process, building energy performance, indoor environment monitoring). In addition, the current state-of-art in technologies enabling Digital Twins was also summarized from the reviewed literature. It was found that most of the prior studies conducted thus far have not fully exploited or realized the envisioned concept of the Digital Twin, and thus classify under the earlier ladder categories. Based on the analysis of the reviewed work and the trends in ongoing research, the authors propose a concept of an advanced Digital Twin for building management as a baseline for further studies.},

That includes the pipeline structures for oil and gas industries or power generation plans and infrastructural transit systems. Prognostics and health management, along with Preventive, predictive, and prescriptive maintenance, are alternative options to avoid the failure in these systems by smart and on-time maintenance. However, although it is possible to collect data dynamically from these systems through their service periods, in many cases, a trustworthy and reliable knowledge base to allow making the right decisions is not always available. This paper presents the concept of LIVE Digital Twin that relies on four phases of Learn, Identify, Verify, Extend employing various Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) simulation strategies during the life span of the structure parallel to its design, performance, inspection, and maintenance. The architecture of LIVE Digital Twin is presented, and the details are described along with some practical case studies in Light Rail Transit (LRT) and pipeline systems in oil and gas industries. The presented concept and architecture of LIVE Digital Twin can be employed and implemented for various other applications and non-structural systems.},

abstract = {Operation and Maintenance (O{\&}M) costs in buildings represent a significant part of the total building life cycle cost. However, project delivery methods in the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry are often focused on the capital delivery stage and associated costs ranging from planning, through design, to construction and handover. Open data standards such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and specifications such as the Construction Operations Building information exchange (COBie) provide the capability to capture Facilities Management (FM) data requirements in a structured manner from the early stages of project development. We aim to investigate how and whether IFC and COBie can deliver the data and information about assets required by facility managers within a whole life cycle perspective. We focus on specific use cases including the creation of asset registers and service life planning. However, the methodology adopted can be generalised and applied to any other FM use case. The results show that IFC, COBie and the tested supporting tools exhibited some shortcomings in delivering some of the data entities, types and parameters required for the selected FM use cases. We discuss these shortcomings and propose them as areas for improvement to domain researchers, standardisation bodies and technology providers. Finally, we instigate domain researchers to adopt the proposed methodology and conduct further FM use cases.},

abstract = {Building Information Models (BIM) have been used in design and construction for many years; however, they are still a relatively new concept in facility management applications. Practices and even terms of model based information management are still under development. That being the case, this series, “Use of models in facility management”, introduces more opportunities and alternatives than requirements. Use of building information models in facility management has also attracted interest internationally. IFC is becoming established as the standard for open information transfer in construction project modeling, and is gradually gaining ground also in facility management. Another open information transfer standard, COBie, has been developed alongside IFC and to supplement it. The main goal of COBie is to facilitate and standardize construction project information transfer from design, construction and commissioning to the needs of facility management. To date, while this new format is not yet in use in Finland, this series contains a short introduction of its application in the BIM management process.},

abstract = {Abstract As the information from diverse disciplines continues to integrate during the whole life cycle of an Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) project, the BIM (Building Information Model/Modeling) becomes increasingly large. This condition will cause users difficulty in acquiring the information they truly desire on a mobile device with limited space for interaction. The situation will be even worse for personnel without extensive knowledge of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) or for nonexperts of the BIM software. To improve the value of the big data of BIM, an approach to intelligent data retrieval and representation for cloud BIM applications based on natural language processing was proposed. First, strategies for data storage and query acceleration based on the popular cloud-based database were explored to handle the large amount of BIM data. Then, the concepts “keyword” and “constraint” were proposed to capture the key objects and their specifications in a natural-language-based sentence that expresses the requirements of the user. Keywords and constraints can be mapped to IFC entities or properties through the International Framework for Dictionaries (IFD). The relationship between the user's requirement and the IFC-based data model was established by path finding in a graph generated from the IFC schema, enabling data retrieval and analysis. Finally, the analyzed and summarized results of BIM data were represented based on the structure of the retrieved data. A prototype application was developed to validate the proposed approach on the data collected during the construction of the terminal of Kunming Airport, the largest single building in China. The case study illustrated the following: (1) relationships between the user requirements and the data users concerned are established, (2) user-concerned data can be automatically retrieved and aggregated based on the cloud for BIM, and (3) the data are represented in a proper form for a visual view and a comprehensive report. With this approach, users can significantly benefit from requesting for information and the value of BIM will be enhanced.},

abstract = {A Digital Twin (DT) refers to a digital replica of physical assets, processes and systems. DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create dynamic digital models that are able to learn and update the status of the physical counterpart from multiple sources. A DT, if equipped with appropriate algorithms will represent and predict future condition and performance of their physical counterparts. Current developments related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets. Most of these developments focus on the architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation {\&} maintenance (O{\&}M) phase, where the value potential is immense. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT is the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of assets. This paper presents a system architecture for developing dynamic DTs in building levels for integrating heterogeneous data sources, support intelligent data query, and provide smarter decision-making processes. This will further bridge the gaps between human relationships with buildings/regions via a more intelligent, visual and sustainable channels. This architecture is brought to life through the development of a dynamic DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge. Specifically, this demonstrator integrates an as-is multi-layered IFC Building Information Model (BIM), building management system data, space management data, real-time Internet of Things (IoTj-based sensor data, asset registry data, and an asset tagging platform. The demonstrator also includes two applications: (1) improving asset maintenance and asset tracking using Augmented Reality (AR); and (2) equipment failure prediction. The long-term goals of this demonstrator are also discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {Industry domains require distinct data and structures of building information models developed and tailored for their disciplines. To seamlessly exchange the building information models, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is one of neutral formats, has been broadly used the architecture, engineering and construction, and facility management industries. Model views definitions (MVD), which is one of the IFC sub-schemas used by domain experts and BIM software vendors, consists of IFC-mapped data exchange requirements of each domain and helps software vendors develop IFC import and export features that allow project participants share and exchange BIM information. Because of the heterogeneous translation processes and structures of IFC interfaces according to model views, their validation is imperative to ensure the integrity of BIM data and maintain a consistent data exchange environment. To accomplish this objective, this paper suggests a new approach to evaluating BIM data in accordance with diverse requirements of MVD. Since MVD entails various types of data exchange specifications, this research examines their embedded checking rule types and categorizes corresponding implementation scenarios. In addition, this paper involves rule logic and IfcDoc-based BIM data validation developed based on the logical rule compositions of identified rules types and checking scenarios. This approach is expected to support sharing consistent BIM data sets and confirming the quality of received data pertaining to the syntax and semantics of a targeted model view.},

abstract = {Despite BIM asset information management processes having advanced to globally recognised standards, facilities and asset integration remains problematic for many companies engaged in the construction project lifecycle. Challenges typically stem from deficiencies in the BIM regulations and standards, inaccurate information exchanges, software interoperability issues and unclear requirement definitions that ultimately result in higher project costs and poorer operational efficiencies. An exploration of these challenges and their potential solutions is therefore important if BIM-FM integration issues are to be improved. Few studies have systematically investigated this subject from the perspective of a BIM-accredited Mechanical and Electrical (M{\&}E) company engaged on projects. This paper combines a literature review with an empirical case study of a BIM-accredited Mechanical and Electrical (M{\&}E) contractor to explore the critical issues surrounding facilities and asset management integration; this combination of evidence providing a distillation of the issues surrounding BIM/FM asset integration and its' resolution. 15 key issues from the literature were classified under 4 broad themes (Informational, Technological, Organisational and Industrial) as being of primary concern; the case study analysis verifying the findings and also providing a series of bespoke recommendations for improving industry practice. The paper clarifies the problem issues (both negotiable and systemic) afflicting the industry, indicating how individual companies can develop their own processes for improving BIM-based asset integration. It may be concluded that although BIM asset integration processes have reached globally recognised standards, systemic characteristics of the industry result in persisting problems that impact the BIM-FM asset management journey.},

abstract = {Purpose – Building information modelling (BIM) in facilities management (FM) applications is an emerging area of research based on the theoretical proposition that BIM information, generated and captured during the lifecycle of a facility, can improve its management. Using this proposition as a starting point, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the value of BIM and the challenges affecting its adoption in FM applications. Design/methodology/approach – Two inter-related research methods are utilised. The literature is utilised to identify the application areas, value and challenges of BIM in FM. Due to the lack of case studies identified in the literature review, and to provide empirical evidence of the value and challenges of BIM in FM, a case study of Northumbria University's city campus, is used to empirically explore the value and challenges of BIM in FM. Findings – The results demonstrated that BIM value in FM stems from improvement to current manual processes of information handover; improvement to the accuracy of FM data, improvement to the accessibility of FM data and efficiency increase in work order execution. The main challenges were the lack of methodologies that demonstrate the tangible benefits of BIM in FM, the limited knowledge of implementation requirement including BIM for FM modelling requirements, the interoperability between BIM and FM technologies, the presence of disparate operational systems managing the same building and finally, the shortage of BIM skills in the FM industry. Originality/value – There is lack of real-life cases on BIM in FM especially for existing assets despite new constructions representing only 1-2 per cent of the total building stock in a typical year. The originality of this paper stems from both adding a real-life case study of BIM in FM and providing empirical evidence of both the value and challenges of BIM in FM applications.},

The process component enables close collaboration and encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project. The paper presents an overview of BIM with focus on its core concepts, applications in the project life cycle and benefits for project stakeholders with the help of case studies. The paper also elaborates risks and barriers to BIM implementation and future trends.},

abstract = {The introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the construction industry is evolving facility maintenance (FM) towards predictive maintenance development. Predictive maintenance of building facilities requires continuously updated data on construction components to be acquired through integrated sensors. The main challenges in developing predictive maintenance tools for building facilities is IoT integration, IoT data visualization on the building 3D model and implementation of maintenance management system on the IoT and building information modeling (BIM). The current 3D building models do not fully interact with IoT building facilities data. Data integration in BIM is challenging. The research aims to integrate IoT alert systems with BIM models to moni-tor building facilities during the operational phase and to visualize building facilities' conditions virtually. To provide efficient maintenance services for building facilities this research proposes an integration of a digital framework based on IoT and BIM platforms. Sensors applied in the building systems and IoT technology on a cloud platform with opensource tools and standards enable monitoring of real-time operation and detecting of different kinds of faults in case of malfunction or failure, therefore sending alerts to facility managers and operators. Proposed preventive maintenance methodology applied on a proof-of-concept heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) plant adopts open source IoT sensor networks. The results show that the integrated IoT and BIM dashboard framework and implemented building structures preventive maintenance methodology are applicable and promising. The automated system architecture of building facilities is intended to provide a reliable and practical tool for real-time data acquisition. Analysis and 3D visualization to support intelligent monitoring of the indoor condition in buildings will enable the facility managers to make faster and better decisions and to improve building facilities' real time monitoring with fallouts on the maintenance timeliness.},

abstract = {Facilities Management (FM) day-to-day tasks require suitable methods to facilitate work orders and improve performance by better collaboration between the office and the field. Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides opportunities to support collaboration and to improve the efficiency of Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) by sharing building information between different applications/users throughout the lifecycle of the facility. However, manual retrieval of building element information can be challenging and time consuming for field workers during FM operations. Mixed Reality (MR) is a visualization technique that can be used to improve visual perception of the facility by superimposing 3D virtual objects and textual information on top of the view of real-world building objects. This paper discusses the development of a collaborative BIM-based MR approach to support facilities field tasks. The proposed framework integrates multisource facilities information, BIM models, and feature-based tracking in an MR-based setting to retrieve information based on time (e.g. inspection schedule) and the location of the field worker, visualize inspection and maintenance operations, and support remote collaboration and visual communication between the field worker and the manager at the office. The field worker uses an Augmented Reality (AR) application installed on his/her tablet. The manager at the office uses an Immersive Augmented Virtuality (IAV) application installed on a desktop computer. Based on the field worker location, as well as the inspection or maintenance schedule, the field worker is given work orders and instructions from the office. Other sensory data (e.g., infrared thermography) can provide additional layers of information by augmenting the actual view of the field worker and supporting him/her in making effective decisions about existing and potential problems while communicating with the office in an Interactive Virtual Collaboration (IVC) mode. Finally, to investigate the applicability of the proposed method, a prototype system is developed and tested in a case study.},

abstract = {Construction clients'owners' demand is currently being recognised as a significant motivation and drive for the construction industry to begin to transform and adopt Building Information Modelling (BIM). In addition, clients can stimulate the innovation to achieve crucial benefits from BIM. However, the implementation of BIM is prevented from being more widely accepted across the construction industry by client fears and a lack of the full understanding of the benefits of BIM, as well as the requirements needed to realise these benefits. Therefore, it is important for client organisations to develop the required competencies that support the BIM implementation process and help to achieve the desired benefits of BIM. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to identify the critical success competencies that facilitate clients to fulfil their roles in the BIM implementation process. Multiple holistic case studies were used as the research strategy and semi-structured interviews were employed as the principal data collection technique. Code-based content analysis and cognitive mapping were used to analyse the verbatim interview transcripts. The data analysis process was facilitated by the computer-aided software, Nvivo. Several types of competencies are identified as critical success factors that enable client organisations to lead the BIM implementation process and increase the efficiency in BIM uses within the UK. In addition, it is concluded that by adopting these competencies, client organisations can enhance their Employer Information Requirements (EIR) and improve their ability to validate the outcome BIM models. These developments will increase client opportunities to meet their desired benefits. This paper provides a contribution to the body of knowledge by identifying BIM organisational maturity competencies for UK clients and their roles in the BIM implementation process, together with establishing the relationship between them. This will enhance the importance of the BIM maturity competencies within the BIM implementation from a clients' perspective. In addition, it will facilitate client organisations evaluating their ability to fulfil their roles through assessing the related competencies.},

abstract = {BIM has been widely adopted by the construction sector, though Facility Management (FM) is still based on a variety of disparate FM systems. The operational phase requires comprehensive set of well-structured information regarding the building asset. Therefore, a BIM model filled with the multifarious information from the pre-use phase ought to be exploited through its integration with existing FM systems. This paper aims to appreciate the contribution of BIM in optimizing the processes conducted conventionally within the FM practice. The importance of sustained information flow for the efficient operational stage is a pre-requisite of the further discussion. The exploration of FM application areas for BIM-enabled processes is aimed to depict the potential of the BIM for FM concept. By elaborating on the existing challenges concerning the shift from traditional FM processes to new BIM-based approach the outstanding problems are realized. On these grounds advice is provided. The study focuses mainly on new investments, where information management must be sustained from the project inception until the current operational stage. The paper proves the potential of BIM for the optimization of FM practices, presenting a wide range of application areas followed by tangible benefits for the building performance across its life-cycle. Identified barriers are assumed to be mitigated by diligent implementation of provided recommendations. It is concluded that BIM-based FM processes have the potential to shed a new light not only on the FM sector itself but on the perception of the whole industry being based on the collaborative approach towards delivery of the intelligent facilities. Nevertheless, such results demand profound cultural changes within the construction sector, with the FM appreciation as a starting point.},

abstract = {Over the past five years Building Information Modeling Software (BIM) has made tremendous inroads in the US-AEC industry. The use of BIM software such as Autodesk Revit is now common place among large US contractors. The model is currently being used for issues such as design, engineering, visualization, conflict resolution, construction simulation, subcontractor co-ordination and cost projection. In theory a BIM model has the capability of being transferred to the owner for use in the maintenance and management of the facility. However these models are not being used by facility managers for maintenance purposes. A significant part of the problem lies in the fact that the model was not created with the information needed by facility managers. This study focuses on the information needed by facility managers in a BIM model. Autodesk Revit is the most popular BIM tool used in the US AEC sector and was hence used in this study. Facility managers were interviewed to obtain the information they would like to see in a BIM model. An existing facility was used and a new BIM model was created with all the information needed by the facility managers. Several innovative techniques were used to input the information in the Revit model. The model was then reviewed by the facility managers and further improved. Some shortcomings were found that the researchers could not resolve using the Revit model. This paper elaborates the creation of a BIM model for facility maintenance and management and the results of the field test.},

Although most owners agree on the potential benefits of integrating BIM technologies with facility management (FM), they must overcome many problems to plan and develop effective BIM execution plans for FM implementation. This study proposes and develops a BIM execution plan for BIM model management for FM during the pre-operation phase. Through the application of the proposed BIM execution plan, BIM can be effectively implemented during the operation and maintenance phases. In order to verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice, the BIM execution plan is then applied in a selected case study of a building project in Taiwan. The combined results demonstrate that the proposed BIM execution plan is an effective approach for operation and maintenance management. The advantage of the proposed BIM execution plan lies not only in improving the efficiency of maintenance management work when integrated with BIM technologies, but also in maximizing the value and benefits of BIM to support maintenance management. Finally, limitations, difficulties, and suggestions are summarized for further development of the BIM execution plan for BIM model management during the pre-operation phase.},

abstract = {Accurate and valid data is essential during the development of building projects and throughout the use phase of buildings. This study proposes a framework to help owners and facility managers in: (a) defining the requirements for asset management tasks in a structured way; (b) validating project and asset data against the established requirements; and (c) visualising asset data, stored in different and distributed sources, in an integrated and interactive way to support specific asset/facility management functions (e.g. maintenance tasks). The framework combines the use of Information Delivery Manual (IDM), Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie), and Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) in the development of Asset Information Models (AM) to fulfil the owner's requirements (Asset Information Requirements) throughout the lifecycle of a building. An AIM is a data model that contains all digital data (graphical, non-graphical, and documentary) required to operate an asset or portfolio of assets. Validation methods are identified for each of the AIM data types and a method for their integration and visualisation is proposed and implemented in a virtual environment. The proposed framework was tested in two use cases that involved (1) the validation of the various data sources against the client requirements, defined in the Asset Information Requirement (AIR); and (2) the visualisation of asset data required for a maintenance task in an interactive virtual environment. The two use cases demonstrated the capability of the framework to enable the definition of AIR and the validation of the different AIM's data deliverables. The visualisation of the AIM data - from different and distributed sources - for a maintenance task was successfully performed in an integrated and interactive game environment. Future work will consider other data sources and will evaluate the proposed framework using real industrial data.},

abstract = {BIM for Facilities Management (BIM for FM) is a relatively new and growing topic of inquiry aiming to fulfil the informational needs of the operational phase of assets within increasingly digitalised project workflows. Research into the management of structured (i.e. graphical and non-graphical) and unstructured data (i.e. documents) has largely focused on design and construction phases. Information management in facilities management and maintenance is still challenged by the lack of a structured framework that can simultaneously fulfil these three capabilities: (1) the delivery of information models (i.e. Asset Information Models) from distributed data sources; (2) the validation of these information models against the requirements; and (3) the use of their information in facilities management (e.g. operation and maintenance). This research aims to develop and test a framework and a prototype Common Data Environment (CDE) to achieve these three capabilities. The framework and the developed CDE are entirely based on use open standards and integration of existing technologies. A requirements model, underpinning the framework and the CDE was developed during three iterative stages of interviews –in line with the adopted Grounded Theory and Design Science Research methodologies– with industry experts and through a three-stage coding process at each iteration. The framework and the CDE were tested in pilot demonstrations with a use case focused on preventive and reactive maintenance. The testing demonstrated that the implementation of ‘BIM for FM' processes is feasible with the proposed framework and CDE relying entirely on open standards and existing technologies. Some additional requirements for BIM for FM processes were also identified during the verification sessions with industry and are proposed for future research.},

This model, known as a building information model, can be used for planning, design, con- struction, and operation of the facility. It helps architects, engineers, and constructors visualize what is to be built in a simulated environment to identify any potential design, construction, or operational issues. BIM represents a new paradigm within AEC, one that encourages integration of the roles of all stakeholders on a project. In this paper, current trends, benefits, possible risks, and future challenges of BIM for the AEC industry are discussed. The findings of this study provide useful information for AEC industry practitioners considering implementing BIM technology in their projects.},

abstract = {The construction industry has worked towards embracing Building Information Model (BIM) innovations for improving the efficiency, accuracy and reliability nowadays. However, the implementation of BIM in building Operations {\&} Maintenance (O{\&}M) is still limited. Previous research only focused on identifying influential factors for the promotion of BIM use in building O{\&}M without considering the systematic manner and the dynamic nature of technology evolution process. This study thus aims to establish an analytical activity system model (ASM) using the activity theory to analyze the BIM use in building O{\&}M in a systematic and dynamic way. The ASMs (traditional and evolutionary) of two different statuses (i.e., without and with BIM-assisted O{\&}M) and the corresponding evolution processes were established based on the critical process models with actors and activities identified in the 1st round interviews with 14 experts. Then, the contradictions as the drivers of evolution in the ASM from the traditional one to the evolutionary BIM-assisted O{\&}M have been examined based on the 2nd round interviews involving the 14 experts and 32 questionnaire surveys. An ASM based driver model of evolution for the BIM-assisted O{\&}M is finally constructed. 26 innovation-oriented internal drivers and six demand-oriented external drivers have been identified, and 21 recommended actions, with the context of social, political and technical influences, have been proposed correspondingly to enhance the identified drivers to achieve BIM-assisted O{\&}M. These results provide a map for O{\&}M practitioners, policy makers and researchers to promote the implementation of BIM in O{\&}M, and are beneficial to the delivery of BIM in building O{\&}M.},

Previous studies have attempted to explore solutions to the problem, with a view to making BIM a more useful decision-support system. However, an integrated conceptual framework summarizing these studies and structuring future development in the area is missing. Based on an ex post facto critical review of 75 papers of this kind published over the past decade, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for bridging BIM and building (BBB), which highlights the importance of synchronizing information between BIM and real-life building processes. The framework is further illustrated through a case study of prefabricated housing construction in Hong Kong. With this integrated conceptual framework, future research on BBB can proceed on a more solid footing.},

Multiple twin aggregations are defined for the production of radiopharmaceuticals: (i) virtual twins of three main sub processes in the production plant; (ii) predictive and decision making twins and their projections in the supervisor for process resilience and global optimization. The control system is organized according to the holonic reference architecture ARTI that enables the concepts of embedded and networked digital twins that provide collective and predictive situation awareness thus bringing closer the software control to the real process evolution. The research reported in this paper demonstrates that the holonic paradigm, first applied to discrete manufacturing process control, can be adapted to the hybrid supervised planning and control of semi-continuous production processes and brings the benefits that holonic organisations provide to living organisms: direct connectivity between physical plant entities (resources, activities and outcomes) and their virtual twins, global optimization, robustness, process resilience and plant sustainability.},

Working under the guidance of well-designed BIM guidelines to insure completeness and compatibility with FM software, architects and contractors can deliver an information rich data model that is valuable to the client. Large owners such as universities often provide these detailed guidelines and deliverable requirements to their building teams. Investigation of the University of Southern California (USC) Facilities Management Service's (FMS) website showed a detailed plan including standards, file names, parameter lists, and other requirements of BIM data, which were specifically designated for facilities management use, as deliverables on new construction projects. Three critical details were also unearthed in the reading of these documents: Revit was the default BIM software; COBie was adapted to help meet facilities management goals; and EcoDomus provided a display of the collected data viewed through Navisworks. Published accounts about the Cinema Arts Complex developed with and under these guidelines reported positive results. Further examination with new projects underway reveal the rapidly changing relational database landscape evident in the new USC "Project Record Revit Requirement Execution Plan (PRxP)".},

Acting on increasing digitalisation pressures, many national and international standards, protocols, and specifications have been generated with little conceptual framing or with no theoretical underpinning. This positioning paper responds to practical business needs of organisations and project teams, builds upon existing conceptual constructs, and delivers a modular information management framework. The Lifecycle Information Transformation and Exchange (LITE) framework is an extendable conceptual skeletal for defining, managing, and integrating project and asset information. Developed, described, and explained for ongoing field testing, the LITE framework integrates multiple components - information statuses, states, milestones, flows, gates, routes, loops, actions, sets, and tiers – which collectively lay the foundations for an open access digital platform being developed by an international Community of Research and Practice. The framework describes – and aims to predict - information flows across an asset's lifecycle. Its modular conceptual structure, iterative flows, and task-oriented terminology are calibrated to guide the integrated design, delivery, and utilisation of assets of any type, function, or scale.},

abstract = {While BIM processes are established for new buildings, the majority of existing buildings is not maintained, refurbished or deconstructed with BIM yet. Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research, involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings. Despite fast developments and spreading standards, challenging research opportunities arise from process automation and BIM adaption to existing buildings' requirements. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Research on digitizing the various aspects of a typical building project has been on the increase since the advent of Building Information Modelling (BIM). Most efforts build on information technology capabilities already achieved in the various professional domains associated with different stages of the building life cycle. It is predicted that BIM will help to drastically reduce errors, fast-track project delivery time and save implementation costs. As such BIM is now being utilized in the various professional domains and project stages. However, research suggests that the building operation and management stage is being left behind despite the abundance of data collected using building management systems (BMS) of varying degrees of sophistication. It is therefore important to consider exploring BIM applications that encompasses the building operation phase. This will enhance the evaluation of building performance in use and provide feedback to the design stage which could help eliminate design-related performance issues. A framework for utilizing feedback loops from building energy consumption to inform and improve design and facility management in a BIM environment is therefore proposed. A prototype illustrating the framework is implemented in. NET framework interfaced with a BIM-enabled tool and tested in the refinement of a pre-designed school using data from the operations phase of another school delivered previously. We conclude that the framework developed in this research can contribute to bridging existing gaps between the design, construction and operation phases of a building's life-cycle.},

This debate has had renewed significance since the emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) processes and the proposition that BIM information, captured during the facilities lifecycle, can help improve the efficiency of Facility Management (FM). Using this proposition as a starting point, the overarching aim of this paper is to investigate the value-adding potential of BIM and the challenges hindering its exploitation in FM. The literature review showed the BIM value adding potential stems from improvement to current manual processes of information handover. It also adds improvement to the accuracy of FM data and increases the efficiency of work orders execution, in terms of speed, to accessing data and locating interventions. It was also revealed that there is lack of real world case studies, especially in the case of existing buildings, despite new constructions representing a small percentage of the total building stock in a typical year. The case study was conducted on an existing asset composed of 32 non-residential buildings in Northumbria University's city campus. This was done to empirically investigate the value of BIM in a specific FM function (i.e. space management). The results provided evidence of the value of BIM in improving the efficiencies of FM work orders and the accuracy of geometric information records.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology, especially the parametric modeling method, can be an efficient solution. This study presents the beneficial effects of applying BIM technology to the design of a slip-form system. First, classification of a tapered slip-form was defined, based on Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) in a top-down approach. Then, working from the defined classification, 3D parametric models of a slip-form were constructed using the script language, SmartPart of Allplan (BIM tool). Finally, the established parametric model was tested by carrying out two different-height cases of tapered concrete pylons, automatically. This parametric design system could also be utilized to improve an efficiency of a formwork process.},

We contribute to the discussion by analysing the Center for Properties and Facilities of the University of Helsinki. We ask (1) what kind of information tools for facility management the maintenance personnel use; (2) how the design data was handed over in the University's central library project; and (3) how designers and facility managers find the possibilities of integrating BIM models and maintenance information systems. In the library project, the data was handed over and archived for potential later use. The information for the maintenance manual, however, was collected separately by an outside consultant. The designers thought that models should be simplified to meet the needs of the maintenance. The representatives of the Center did not see that uses of BIM models would provide a significant added value in relation to the potential provided by the maintenance information systems already in use. They found as a possible next step the transfer of some information from BIM models to their facility management and maintenance systems. A partial, stepwise integration of the systems seems to be a realistic way forward.},

abstract = {Smart buildings are the trend of the next generation's commercial buildings that link different building systems together with the Building Automation System (BAS). Building information modeling (BIM) assists in data exchange and information flow. Previous research has explored BAS and BIM integration for energy management, building design optimization and operation, and building fault detection and diagnostics. However, it is rarely seen to design BAS or exchange BAS information in different project stages using BIM tools. The current design of the BAS system is either using 2D drawings based on AutoCAD or vendor customized tools. Unlike the other building systems, BAS seldom participates in design-build BIM cycle but blends into facility management in the later stage. To tackle this issue, this research aims to set a fundamental step to facilitate information exchange for BIM assisted BAS design and operation using one of the BAS open communication protocol named Building Automation and Control Networks (BACnet) and open BIM standard Industry Foundation Class (IFC). This paper leverages Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and Model View Definition (MVD) methodologies to define an IFC subset schema (a BACnet MVD) so that BAS information conforming to the BACnet protocol can be represented in IFC data model for information exchange throughout various project stages with BIM tools. Revit and a web browser were used to demonstrate the implementation of the BACnet MVD for BAS information exchange. In this way, BAS information represented in the open BIM standard can unlock the potential of future smart building information exchange and integration.},

abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the use of virtual building information models to develop building design solutions and design documentation and to analyse construction processes. Recent advances in IT have enabled advanced knowledge management, which in turn facilitates sustainability and improves asset management in the civil construction industry. There are several important qualifiers and some disadvantages of the current suite of technologies. This paper outlines the benefits, enablers, and barriers associated with BIM and makes suggestions about how these issues may be addressed. The paper highlights the advantages of BIM, particularly the increased utility and speed, enhanced fault finding in all construction phases, and enhanced collaborations and visualisation of data. The paper additionally identifies a range of issues concerning the implementation of BIM as follows: IP, liability, risks, and contracts and the authenticity of users. Implementing BIM requires investment in new technology, skills training, and development of new ways of collaboration and Trade Practices concerns. However, when these challenges are overcome, BIM as a new information technology promises a new level of collaborative engineering knowledge management, designed to facilitate sustainability and asset management issues in design, construction, asset management practices, and eventually decommissioning for the civil engineering industry. {\textcopyright} 2013 Robbert Anton Kivits and Craig Furneaux.},

abstract = {In the existing building facilities context, the BIM substantial intervention concerning semantics and as-is information based portrayal for maintenance requirements is very confined. This confinement stresses the challenges associated with the lack and absence of reusing existing building facilities, as is domain knowledge. Within this scope, this paper proposes a novel approach for existing building facilities semantic-enrichment from indoor digital scanning portrayal phase to semantics depiction and management phase for renovation, rehabilitation, or restoration functions. In this paper, we present an ontological system, which relies on integrating the as-is information BIM and semantic web technology. The developed approach improves existing building facilities, as-is information formalization, and management for maintenance purposes. The paper outcome is a semantically integrated knowledge-based framework that can potentially: 1) constitute a semantic database for building facilities components as-is information using BIM; 2) overcome the lack and absence of retrieving and reusing building facilities as-is domain information; and (3) formalize the building facilities as-is knowledge in a computable way.},

abstract = {Operation and Maintenance (O{\&}M) stage is the most expensive phase during the life cycle of a building. Currently, much of the information used in there is still paper-based and is delivered to the owner months after the facilities are in use. Therefore, it is necessary to study the interaction between Lean principles and Building Information Modeling(BIM) Functionalities in the building during O{\&}M phase to optimize resources. This paper proposes a BIM-FM workflow and compares it with traditional Facility Management in a Peruvian sports infrastructure. The case study was Aquatic Center for the XVIII Pan-American Games and VI Parapan-American Games Lima 2019. The sport infrastructure was designed and built under an Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) environment applying BIM methodology until the construction phase. The main difference found is that proposed BIM-FM workflow improves the efficiencies of the workforce for accessing to accuracy and complete information about Facility's components. Finally, the paper presents barriers in the BIM-FM implementation evidenced in the case study.},

abstract = {The low accessibility to the information regarding buildings current performances causes deep difficulties in planning appropriate interventions. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors make available a high quantity of data on energy consumptions and indoor conditions of an existing building that can drive the choice of energy retrofit interventions. Moreover, the current developments in the topic of the digital twin are leading the diffusion of Building Information Modeling (BIM) methods and tools that can provide valid support to manage all data and information for the retrofit process. This paper shows the aim and the findings of research focused on testing the integrated use of BIM methodology and IoT systems. A common data platform for the visualization of building indoor conditions (e.g., temperature, luminance etc.) and of energy consumption parameters was carried out. This platform, tested on a case study located in Italy, is developed with the integration of low-cost IoT sensors and the Revit model. To obtain a dynamic and automated exchange of data between the sensors and the BIM model, the Revit software was integrated with the Dynamo visual programming platform and with a specific Application Programming Interface (API). It is an easy and straightforward tool that can provide building managers with real-time data and information about the energy consumption and the indoor conditions of buildings, but also allows for viewing of the historical sensor data table and creating graphical historical sensor data. Furthermore, the BIM model allows the management of other useful information about the building, such as dimensional data, functions, characteristics of the components of the building, maintenance status etc., which are essential for a much more conscious, effective and accurate management of the building and for defining the most suitable retrofit scenarios.},

abstract = {Although more than 65{\%} of the total cost in facility management (FM) comes from facility maintenance management (FMM), there is a lack of efficient maintenance strategies and right decision making approaches to reduce FMM costs. Building information modeling (BIM) has been developed as a potential technology for FMM in buildings. This study proposes an FMM framework based on BIM and facility management systems (FMSs), which can provide automatic scheduling of maintenance work orders (MWOs) to enhance good decision making in FMM. In this framework, data are mapped between BIM and FMSs according to the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) extension of maintenance tasks and MWO information in order to achieve data integration. After bi-directional data transmission between the BIM models and FMSs, work order information is visualized in BIM via API to identify components that have failed. Second, geometric and semantic information of the failure components is extracted from the BIM models to calculate the sub-optimal maintenance path in the BIM environment. Third, the MWO schedule is automatically generated using a modified Dijkstra algorithm that considers four factors, namely, problem type, emergency level, distance among components, and location. Illustrative examples are given in the paper to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework in indoor and outdoor 3D environments.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is firstly to summarize the status quo of the building information management technologies applied in the facility management and operations (FM{\&}O) sector and identifying prevailing issues; and secondly, to devise technical solutions for those issues based on an exemplar case. Background: Considerable financial losses could occur as the result of insufficient interoperability issues among information systems. In order to minimize losses, Building Information Management (BIM) tools must be able to interoperate with a variety of digital FM{\&}O systems. Approach: This research applies the principles of grounded theory as well as conceptual constructs of a proposed BIM framework. Firstly, descriptions of information management systems of eleven projects in technical reports are analyzed and the prevailing technical issues extracted. Then, a narrative representation of an IT-implementation project together with its organizational context has been provided. Finally, the most important issues from recent projects have been presented together with their respective solutions provided by the case project. Results: The results demonstrate that the most important issues in implementing BIM for streamlining FM{\&}O activities are lack of guidelines and efficient technologies for capturing BIM models of existing facilities, coping with non-consistent terminologies and taxonomies, requirements specification in BIM applications, and identifying which information and what levels of detail are desired by the FM{\&}O teams. Practical implications: In addition to scholars, the results are useful to database implementers and database designers, as well as decision-making buddies in the FM{\&}O sector.},

abstract = {It is critical that an asset-centric organisation understand the importance of their engineered assets to operate successfully. Despite this, organisations struggle to view assets within the context of whole-life management and ultimately struggle to harness their full potential value. A recurring theme is the challenges in capturing, storing and validating data across a diverse and complex asset portfolio. The primary reason for this is the fundamental lack of understanding of what information should be collected to support the efficient management of assets throughout their life. Asset-related information that is not collected in alignment to the organisational requirements will restrict the performance of capital investment decisions, risk management and operational performance throughout the whole life of the asset portfolio and ultimately have an impact on productivity. This paper presents a top-down methodology that utilises Building Information Modelling to support the development of Asset Information Requirements. The novel aspect of this approach is the development of Functional Information Requirements to bridge the gap between organisational requirements and Asset Information Requirements.},

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to suggest and develop a building information modeling (BIM) database based on BIM perspective definition metadata for connecting external facility management (FM) and BIM data, which considers variability and expandability from the user's perspective. The BIM-based FM system must be able to support different use cases per user role and effectively extract information required by the use cases from various heterogeneous data sources. If the FM system's user perspective becomes structurally fixed when developing the system, the lack of expandability can cause problems for maintenance and reusability. BIM perspective definition (BPD) metadata helps increase expandability and system reusability because it supports system variability, which allows adding or changing the user perspective even after the system has been developed. The information to be dealt with differs according to the user's role, which also means that the data model, data conversion rules, and expression methods change per perspective. The perspective should be able to extract only the user-requested data from the heterogeneous system's data source and format it in the style demanded by the user. In order to solve such issues, we analyzed the practice of FM and the benefits of using BIM-based FM, and we proposed a BPD that supports data extraction and conversion and created a prototype.},

abstract = {The industry foundation classes (IFC) data schema is generic, designed to support the full range of model exchanges needed in the construction industry. For any particular working exchange for some sub-domain of building construction, a set of model view definitions (MVD) is required to specify exactly what information should be exchanged, and in what form and structure the IFC entities are to be used. Defining model view definitions requires principle decisions and workarounds because the IFC itself does not address a number of semantic issues comprehensively. Some of the issues identified and discussed include the typing of objects, instances, geometry, relationships, and rules, which are supported in the IFC schema, and the complexities of exchanging such information accurately between applications. This paper advances the idea of MVD Concepts as an object-oriented and modular mechanism for embedding semantic meaning in model views. We conclude that although the IFC product model schema is richly expressive, it lacks formal definition of its entities, attributes, and relationships. To achieve standardized and re-usable model views, further research towards a modular and logical framework based on formal specification of IFC concepts is recommended. This research is expected to impact the overall interoperability of applications in the building information modeling realm. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The adoption of building information modeling (BIM) in the design and construction phases of building projects has increased considerably in recent years; however, its use in postconstruction is still lagging. Much of this is because of the lack of experience by owner organizations in using BIM during operations and maintenance (O{\&}M). The architecture, engineering, construction, and operations (AECO) industry is undergoing a major paradigm shift that will require building owners to develop lifecycle-oriented BIM strategies. Consequently, owners will play a vital role in improving the maturity of future BIM-assisted projects through their requirements documentation, assessment of the quality and accuracy of BIM deliverables, and continued application of BIM during facilities management (FM). The primary objective of this research study was to develop a framework for building owner organizations to use in the assessment of their BIM competency. Using the Delphi technique, 66 critical factors that are influential in the evaluation of owners' BIM competency were identified and prioritized on the basis of the perceptions of 21 prequalified BIMexperts. The data derived from the Delphi phase were then used to propose an assessment tool that allows owners to evaluate their operations across three diverse competency areas and 12 specifically tailored competency categories. These evaluations can then be used by owners to assess and expand their technical knowledge, improve their current BIM requirements, and increase the efficiency of their postconstruction operations.

abstract = {The opportunities for leveraging Building Information Models (BIMs) for facility operations are compelling and yet utilization of BIMs during building operation and maintenance is falling behind the BIM implementations for design and construction. Current studies of BIMs used for the operations phase and commercially available technologies focus on transferring information from the design and construction phases to the operations phase by enabling creation and capturing of digital facility information throughout the facility lifecycle. Some of the commercial systems provide automated transfer of such information from BIM to Computerized Maintenance and Management Systems (CMMS) and/or Computer Aided Facility Management (CAFM) Systems but the focus of recent studies is limited to automated transfer of space and asset data with some emphasis on gathering the manufacturer and maintenance schedule information. Hence, currently available facility management systems are not benefiting from the 3D visualization capabilities that BIMs provide and the topological relationships between components already available in them. In this paper, the authors discuss opportunities for utilizing BIMs for facilities management, with a specific emphasis on supporting maintenance planning. The envisioned approach does not only make use of the information in a BIM that is transferred from design and construction phases, but also leverages the spatial relationships represented in a BIM for visualization and analyses of facility data. Along with this vision, the authors present results of a case study in which work orders generated during a one year period for a campus building were investigated and manually integrated into a BIM of that building in order to assess possible benefits that might be gained through the usage of a BIM for maintenance planning. Some of these benefits include: trend analysis of breakdowns at certain locations and under certain topological relationships and analysis and visualization of spatial relationships of work orders for more effective reactive maintenance and preventive planning.},

abstract = {The asset management phase of a building constitutes approximately 60{\%} of its total lifecycle costs. However, significant unnecessary expenses occur in current asset management practices because of the separation of the design and construction phases from operation and maintenance and the lack of an effective building asset management system covering all types of buildings with numerous components. Asset management decision-making is inherently a process that requires the assimilation of a multitude of data, processes, and software systems. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated decision support system for building asset management that addresses the systematization and coordination of lifecycle data. In this approach, a lifecycle work breakdown structure (WBS) for the asset management system is developed to provide a unified hierarchy to categorize and organize building assets. It is then used to develop the WBS-based integrated building lifecycle asset management model through a relational database management system (DBMS). Since building information modelling (BIM) is a rich information-based platform with large volumes of asset data needed, it is integrated with the WBS-based DBMS to achieve an effective integrated building asset management. A case study of an educational building is presented and discussed in the paper to demonstrate how the proposed automated solution is used for asset management. The research contributes to the body of knowledge by formalizing a WBS-based unified asset inventory hierarchy and mapping BIM data to the proposed hierarchy for effective asset management.},

A number of the latest advancements and emergent trends were identified based on knowledge maps in FM, including changing circumstances, enhancing information technology, all-around facility manager, strategic performance management, sustainable FM and innovative FM practice. It is hoped that this review can help researchers understand the current body of FM knowledge. The future directions were also highlighted in this study to help researchers identify areas where research is most needed.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This paper examines a recent survey of the experiences of facilities managers in the rapidly growing and evolving industry in regard to the barriers and their commitment to the sustainability agenda. The survey results show that time constraints, lack of knowledge and lack of senior management commitment are the main barriers for the implementation of consistent and comprehensive sustainable FM policy and practice. The paper concludes that the diversity of the FM role and the traditional undervaluation of the contribution it makes to the success of organisations are partially responsible for lack of success in achieving sustainable facilities. The overwhelming barrier for sustainable FM practice is the lack of understanding, focus and commitment of senior executives in appreciating the opportunities, threats and need for strategic leadership and direction in driving essential change, and hence further the sustainability agenda. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers. A digital twin (DT) refers to a digital replica of physical assets, processes, and systems. DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources as well as represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation and maintenance (O{\&}M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysis, supports decision-making processes in O{\&}M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learned and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices. Through developing this DT demonstrator, the results provide a clear roadmap and present particular DT research efforts for asset management practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to promote the implementation and development of DT at the building and city levels.},

Hence, they may be unable to develop their operational information requirements to request the right data from the design and construction phases. This paper investigates the operational information requirements of three asset owners through a comparative study. A qualitative multi-case study approach was used to collect and analyse the operational information requirements of three asset owners. A qualitative content analysis was also utilised to identify key asset information requirements and categories. The study revealed that operational information requirements are strongly related to business needs and that it is not possible to develop a rigid list of requirements for asset owners, but rather some templates to help them define their data requirements. Of a total of 172 analysed information requirements, only 7 requirements were common in all cases and 16 were common in 2 cases, which represents 4{\%} and 9{\%} of the total. The research addressed a significant research gap regarding the development of operational information requirements for asset owners. Moreover, the paper provides templates to help guide asset owners when defining their data requirements for asset operations in order to derive BIM business value.},

While some of these needs are addressed by several existing FM information systems, building information modeling (BIM), which is becoming widely adopted by the construction industry, holds undeveloped possibilities for providing and supporting FM practices with its functionalities of visualization, analysis, control, and so on. This paper explores how BIM can be a beneficial platform for supplementing FM practices. An online survey and face-to-face interviews were conducted to assess the current status of BIM implementations in FM, potential applications, and the level of interest in the utilization of BIM. Interactions between BIM and FM are defined by illustrating application areas and data requirements for BIM-enabled FM practices. Highlighting the synergy between the two, this paper can help professionals recognize potential areas in which BIM can be useful in FM practices.

abstract = {For a sustainable building, the use of energy always concerns clients and designers. In this respect, the UK national regulation on energy performance and ‘carbon' accounting has asked for a greater consistency of construction information to achieve the CO2 emission target. Therefore, Clients and Industry should work closely together in developing plans to make the transition to low carbon buildings feasible in order to meet the CO2 emission target. In this context, Building Information Modelling (BIM) can play a key role in addition to its capability to create more homogenisation of the construction supply-chain. For the energy analysis packages, the designers usually receive feedback on their design; such as how much energy the building will use, what are the anticipated CO2 emissions and if the building will pass performance criteria (such as: LEED or BREEAM). BIM applications for energy analysis have been introduced to improve this process but mostly at the design stage. However, for the post-occupancy stage, there is a need for a proper and systematic methodology to monitor the behaviour of buildings and to make critical decisions to ensure that the energy criteria of the design are really met in practice. This paper introduces a conceptual BIM-based model that can improve the post-occupancy evaluation process and meet the industry requirements for sustainable buildings.},

A case study is presented to show that DEA can provide FM personnel with an objective view on performance improvements. An objective of the case study is to investigate the relative efficiency of nine facilities with the same goals and to determine the most efficient facility. The case is limited to nine buildings in FM on four inputs and nine output criteria. The paper concludes by demonstrating that DEA-generated improvement targets can be applied when formulating FM outsourcing policies, strategies and improvements. Facility manager can apply DEA-generated improvement targets in formulating FM outsourcing policies, specifications development, FM strategy and planning. FM benchmarking with DEA can enhance continuous improvement in services' efficiency and cost saving. This will help reduce utility cost as well as pollution.

One of the many ways the laboratory animal specialist contributes to research control of animal-related variables is through design of the animal housing facility. Control of genetic variables is primarily a matter of biology, but control of other variables is dependent to a significant degree on the design and management of the research animal facility (Hessler, 1999). Biosecurity (defined as all measures taken to detect, prevent, contain, and eradicate adventitious infections) is also critical, as infectious agents are well recognized to perturb the animal's physiology and biologic responses, potentially affecting research results (reviewed in Chapter 29). Environmental variables, including genetic, microbial, chemical, and physical, are illustrated in Fig. 36.1. This chapter considers the salient design features of contemporary research animal facilities that effectively control environmental variables and allow for the maintenance of high-quality animal care and use standards while minimizing operational costs. The chapter also includes an overview of macro- and microenvironmental conditions and monitoring, operational considerations, housing systems, select equipment employed, and materials routinely used in animal care facilities.},

abstract = {Building Information modeling (BIM) has the potential to advance and transform facilities Operation and Maintenance (O{\&}M) by providing a platform for facility managers to retrieve, analyze, and process building information in a digitalized 3D environment. Currently, because of rapid developments in BIM, researchers and industry professionals need a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in facility O{\&}M. This paper presents a review of recent publications on the topic. It aims to evaluate and summarize the current BIM-O{\&}M research and application developments from a facility manager's point of view, analyze research trends, and identify research gaps and promising future research directions. The scope of this research includes the academic articles, industry reports and guidelines pertaining to using BIM to improve selected facility O{\&}M activities, including maintenance and repair, emergency management, energy management, change/relocation management, and security. The content analysis results show that research on BIM for O{\&}M is still in its early stage and most of the current research has focused on energy management. We have identified that the interoperability in the BIM-O{\&}M context is still a challenge and adopting the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Framework is a potential starting point to address this issue. More studies involving surveys are needed to understand the underlying O{\&}M principles for BIM implementation – data requirements, areas of inefficiencies, the process changes. In addition, more studies on the return on investment of the innovative systems are required to justify the value of BIM-O{\&}M applications and an improved Life Cycle Cost Analysis method is critical for such justifications.},

Owners often receive disconnected documents, specifications, and/or equipment manuals; additionally, they receive semi­accurate construction documents and electronic models to which the documents pertain. This information is then processed to various degrees of effectiveness and placed into a system used for Facility Management. Not surprisingly, many of these models are electronic versions of completely disjointed information. As a result, BIM fails to deliver as intended. ENGworks has developed methods through which proper documentation is gathered, verified, and processed. This information is available to the user through a customized proprietary web­based environment, ensuring the owner has global accessibility.

We use a semantic based approach that uses a global ontology to mediate among the schemas of the data sources. In our framework, a query is expressed in terms of one of the data sources or of the global ontology and is then translated into subqueries on the other data sources using mappings based on a common vocabulary.

abstract = {Incomplete building information in delivery and the lack of compatible tools for Operation and Maintenance (O{\&}M) have hindered the development of the intelligent management of Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) systems. In fact, the information related to the O{\&}M management of the MEP system conventionally comes from the completion documents in the forms of hard copies or unstructured digital files, making it hard to search for useful information in the “sea” of documents and drawings. Therefore, digitalization of information is an urgent task to facilitate the intelligent management of the MEP system. As a project deliverable, the as-built information model shall not only contain geometrical information and necessary construction-related data, but also built-in information useful for the intelligent O{\&}M management. In the present study, based on the Building Information Modeling/Model (BIM) technology, a set of solutions including the automatic establishment of the logic chain for MEP systems, an equipment grouping and labeling scheme and an algorithm to transform BIM information to GIS map model, is proposed to digitalize and integrate the MEP-related information into the as-built model. Subsequently, a cross-platform O{\&}M management system is developed using the MEP-related information in the as-built model to run routine O{\&}M tasks and to effectively response to MEP-related emergencies. The developed system is applied to aid the O{\&}M management of MEP engineering in a real project, showing that the developed system facilitates the intelligent O{\&}M management and guarantees the security of the MEP system and its subsystems.},

abstract = {This article focuses on how to specify relevant information content in objects and object libraries in order to exchange relevant and reliable information in building information model (BIM)-based software. There is a general lack of professional information in BIM-based designs. The AECOO (architects, engineers, contractors, owners and operators) industry should therefore take the initiative to achieve a broad consensus about the specification of relevant information that should be standardized as content in the objects. Improved exchange of information in BIM-based software will support integrated design and delivery solutions. Objects/object libraries are proposed as the container for the exchange of information. Software objects (doors, windows, walls) and object libraries (selections of objects) with specified professional information (measurements, performance, energy, fire resistance, noise reduction, etc.) are called 'BIM objects'. The 'role-and life-cycle information model' (RIM/LIM) concept is suggested as a framework for development (specification) of relevant information in different roles and phases of a building's life cycle. A 'BIM object information standard' can be based on the RIM/LIM framework. Content in the BIM objects can be included as specifications in information delivery manuals and BIM guides. {\textcopyright} 2010 Earthscan.},

Nevertheless, in order to achieve a sustainable performance, a balance between environmental, social and economic criteria has to be created. There are already different tools available which have the potential to reach this goal. It is necessary to identify them as such and find out how they can be integrated to obtain synergies and contribute to sustainable construction. These tools have to be implemented in early design phases so as to add value to the project. In the present paper, two powerful methods, namely BIM and LCA, will be highlighted. Such methods can be of great assistance in the context of sustainability. On the one hand, BIM supports integrated design and improves information management and cooperation between the different stakeholders throughout the different project life-cycle phases. On the other hand, LCA is a suitable method for assessing environmental performance. Both LCA and BIM should be integrated in the decision-making process at an early stage with a view to achieving a holistic overview of the project, including environmental criteria, from the beginning.},

abstract = {BIM for Facilities Management (BIM for FM) is a relatively new and growing topic of inquiry aiming to fulfil the informational needs of the operational phase of assets within increasingly digitalised project workflows. Research into the management of structured (i.e. graphical and non-graphical) and unstructured data (i.e. documents) has largely focused on design and construction phases. Information management in facilities management and maintenance is still challenged by the lack of a structured framework that can simultaneously fulfil these three capabilities: (1) the delivery of information models (i.e. Asset Information Models) from distributed data sources; (2) the validation of these information models against the requirements; and (3) the use of their information in facilities management (e.g. operation and maintenance). This research aims to develop and test a framework and a prototype Common Data Environment (CDE) to achieve these three capabilities. The framework and the developed CDE are entirely based on use open standards and integration of existing technologies. A requirements model, underpinning the framework and the CDE was developed during three iterative stages of interviews –in line with the adopted Grounded Theory and Design Science Research methodologies– with industry experts and through a three-stage coding process at each iteration. The framework and the CDE were tested in pilot demonstrations with a use case focused on preventive and reactive maintenance. The testing demonstrated that the implementation of ‘BIM for FM' processes is feasible with the proposed framework and CDE relying entirely on open standards and existing technologies. Some additional requirements for BIM for FM processes were also identified during the verification sessions with industry and are proposed for future research.},

abstract = {THIS IS THE VISION FOR BUILDING information modelling (BIM) for facili- ty management (FM): click a 3D object in a BIM and instantly have current, user- specific asset data. Although such a BIM promises an opportunity to improve pro- ductivity, support proactive decision mak- ing and reduce costs, the industry must acknowledge the challenges that have to be overcome before facility managers, build- ing operators and others will have a BIM that aligns with this vision. Tis article identifies five challenges along with rec- ommendations to overcome them},

@article{McArthur2015,
abstract = {Building Information Management (BIM) models are transforming how buildings are designed and constructed, and can facilitate multi-disciplinary coordination, and integrate 3D design, analysis, cost estimating, and construction scheduling. By extending the model into the post-occupancy period, BIM models can be used to support Facilities Management and Building Operations, and offer a consolidated interface for information regarding all aspects of building operational performance. Four key challenges must be overcome to develop BIM models suitable for Sustainable Operations management: (1) identification of critical information required to inform Operational decisions, (3) the high level of effort to create new or modify existing BIM models for the building(s), (2) the management of information transfer between real-time operations and monitoring systems and the BIM model, and (4) the handling of uncertainty based on incomplete building documentation. This paper describes the process used to addresses and overcome each of these challenges. The BIM framework and its refinement are presented along with evaluative data from a case study where a model was developed using this framework for a complex university building. The results of this study demonstrate how these BIM models can be developed for the most challenging existing building scenarios and effectively used to improve building management and performance.},

@article{Yilmaz2023,
abstract = {BIM adoption has accelerated worldwide since it is an important enabling technology for digitalisation in the construction industry. Adopting BIM requires transforming the traditional building life cycle stages (planning, design, construction and facilities management) into BIM-integrated project deliveries. Assessing the BIM capabilities of these stages helps organisations to identify gaps in their BIM uses and improve them. There is a lack of a comprehensive model in the literature for assessing the BIM capabilities of individual building life cycle stages and their processes. Existing assessment models focus on assessing the BIM maturity of construction projects and organisations which do not inform the required BIM improvements for individual stages and their processes. Hence, we iteratively developed the Building Information Modelling (BIM) Capability Assessment REference Model (BIM-CAREM) and demonstrated its usability through multiple explanatory case studies performed with two international design and engineering companies and two general contractors in Turkey. We assessed the BIM capabilities of design, construction and facility management processes of various buildings i.e. residential, stadiums, hospitals and airports. The results showed that the BIM capability levels of design, construction and facility management processes vary within and across the companies.},
