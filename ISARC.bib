   abstract = {Through years of experience, ENGworks knows as construction nears completion, a drop in the level of attention to detail regarding documentation occurs. Owners often receive disconnected documents, specifications, and/or equipment manuals; additionally, they receive semi­accurate construction documents and electronic models to which the documents pertain. This information is then processed to various degrees of effectiveness and placed into a system used for Facility Management. Not surprisingly, many of these models are electronic versions of completely disjointed information. As a result, BIM fails to deliver as intended. ENGworks has developed methods through which proper documentation is gathered, verified, and processed. This information is available to the user through a customized proprietary web­based environment, ensuring the owner has global accessibility. The Owner or Facility Manager will have full access to a simple yet powerful virtual building model containing relevant information to manage property, building systems, and components for the life of the facility.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this research is to suggest and develop a building information modeling (BIM) database based on BIM perspective definition metadata for connecting external facility management (FM) and BIM data, which considers variability and expandability from the user's perspective. The BIM-based FM system must be able to support different use cases per user role and effectively extract information required by the use cases from various heterogeneous data sources. If the FM system's user perspective becomes structurally fixed when developing the system, the lack of expandability can cause problems for maintenance and reusability. BIM perspective definition (BPD) metadata helps increase expandability and system reusability because it supports system variability, which allows adding or changing the user perspective even after the system has been developed. The information to be dealt with differs according to the user's role, which also means that the data model, data conversion rules, and expression methods change per perspective. The perspective should be able to extract only the user-requested data from the heterogeneous system's data source and format it in the style demanded by the user. In order to solve such issues, we analyzed the practice of FM and the benefits of using BIM-based FM, and we proposed a BPD that supports data extraction and conversion and created a prototype.},

   abstract = {The industry foundation classes (IFC) data schema is generic, designed to support the full range of model exchanges needed in the construction industry. For any particular working exchange for some sub-domain of building construction, a set of model view definitions (MVD) is required to specify exactly what information should be exchanged, and in what form and structure the IFC entities are to be used. Defining model view definitions requires principle decisions and workarounds because the IFC itself does not address a number of semantic issues comprehensively. Some of the issues identified and discussed include the typing of objects, instances, geometry, relationships, and rules, which are supported in the IFC schema, and the complexities of exchanging such information accurately between applications. This paper advances the idea of MVD Concepts as an object-oriented and modular mechanism for embedding semantic meaning in model views. We conclude that although the IFC product model schema is richly expressive, it lacks formal definition of its entities, attributes, and relationships. To achieve standardized and re-usable model views, further research towards a modular and logical framework based on formal specification of IFC concepts is recommended. This research is expected to impact the overall interoperability of applications in the building information modeling realm. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the use of virtual building information models to develop building design solutions and design documentation and to analyse construction processes. Recent advances in IT have enabled advanced knowledge management, which in turn facilitates sustainability and improves asset management in the civil construction industry. There are several important qualifiers and some disadvantages of the current suite of technologies. This paper outlines the benefits, enablers, and barriers associated with BIM and makes suggestions about how these issues may be addressed. The paper highlights the advantages of BIM, particularly the increased utility and speed, enhanced fault finding in all construction phases, and enhanced collaborations and visualisation of data. The paper additionally identifies a range of issues concerning the implementation of BIM as follows: IP, liability, risks, and contracts and the authenticity of users. Implementing BIM requires investment in new technology, skills training, and development of new ways of collaboration and Trade Practices concerns. However, when these challenges are overcome, BIM as a new information technology promises a new level of collaborative engineering knowledge management, designed to facilitate sustainability and asset management issues in design, construction, asset management practices, and eventually decommissioning for the civil engineering industry. © 2013 Robbert Anton Kivits and Craig Furneaux.},

However, slip-form systems have been designed using 2D drawing methods, which hinders the utilization of project information and impedes essential communication between project participants. The application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology, especially the parametric modeling method, can be an efficient solution. This study presents the beneficial effects of applying BIM technology to the design of a slip-form system. First, classification of a tapered slip-form was defined, based on Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) in a top-down approach. Then, working from the defined classification, 3D parametric models of a slip-form were constructed using the script language, SmartPart of Allplan (BIM tool). Finally, the established parametric model was tested by carrying out two different-height cases of tapered concrete pylons, automatically. This parametric design system could also be utilized to improve an efficiency of a formwork process.},

   abstract = {Purpose – Building information modelling (BIM) in facilities management (FM) applications is an emerging area of research based on the theoretical proposition that BIM information, generated and captured during the lifecycle of a facility, can improve its management. Using this proposition as a starting point, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the value of BIM and the challenges affecting its adoption in FM applications. Design/methodology/approach – Two inter-related research methods are utilised. The literature is utilised to identify the application areas, value and challenges of BIM in FM. Due to the lack of case studies identified in the literature review, and to provide empirical evidence of the value and challenges of BIM in FM, a case study of Northumbria University’s city campus, is used to empirically explore the value and challenges of BIM in FM. Findings – The results demonstrated that BIM value in FM stems from improvement to current manual processes of information handover; improvement to the accuracy of FM data, improvement to the accessibility of FM data and efficiency increase in work order execution. The main challenges were the lack of methodologies that demonstrate the tangible benefits of BIM in FM, the limited knowledge of implementation requirement including BIM for FM modelling requirements, the interoperability between BIM and FM technologies, the presence of disparate operational systems managing the same building and finally, the shortage of BIM skills in the FM industry. Originality/value – There is lack of real-life cases on BIM in FM especially for existing assets despite new constructions representing only 1-2 per cent of the total building stock in a typical year. The originality of this paper stems from both adding a real-life case study of BIM in FM and providing empirical evidence of both the value and challenges of BIM in FM applications.},

   abstract = {Facilities Management (FM) day-to-day tasks require suitable methods to facilitate work orders and improve performance by better collaboration between the office and the field. Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides opportunities to support collaboration and to improve the efficiency of Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) by sharing building information between different applications/users throughout the lifecycle of the facility. However, manual retrieval of building element information can be challenging and time consuming for field workers during FM operations. Mixed Reality (MR) is a visualization technique that can be used to improve visual perception of the facility by superimposing 3D virtual objects and textual information on top of the view of real-world building objects. This paper discusses the development of a collaborative BIM-based MR approach to support facilities field tasks. The proposed framework integrates multisource facilities information, BIM models, and feature-based tracking in an MR-based setting to retrieve information based on time (e.g. inspection schedule) and the location of the field worker, visualize inspection and maintenance operations, and support remote collaboration and visual communication between the field worker and the manager at the office. The field worker uses an Augmented Reality (AR) application installed on his/her tablet. The manager at the office uses an Immersive Augmented Virtuality (IAV) application installed on a desktop computer. Based on the field worker location, as well as the inspection or maintenance schedule, the field worker is given work orders and instructions from the office. Other sensory data (e.g., infrared thermography) can provide additional layers of information by augmenting the actual view of the field worker and supporting him/her in making effective decisions about existing and potential problems while communicating with the office in an Interactive Virtual Collaboration (IVC) mode. Finally, to investigate the applicability of the proposed method, a prototype system is developed and tested in a case study.},

This task is difficult because of the complex interaction and interdependencies between different building components.

This paper aims to utilize BIM visualization capabilities to provide FM technicians with visualizations that allow them to utilize their cognitive and perceptual reasoning for problem solving. It investigates a knowledge-assisted BIM-based visual analytics approach for failure root-cause detection in FM. For this purpose, the inspection and maintenance data of Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) are integrated with a BIM. Moreover, various sources of building knowledge such as fault trees and relationships between components are formally represented. These resources are used to create custom visualizations through an interactive user interface which helps in exploiting the heuristic problem solving ability of field experts to find root causes of failures in a building. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The opportunities for leveraging Building Information Models (BIMs) for facility operations are compelling and yet utilization of BIMs during building operation and maintenance is falling behind the BIM implementations for design and construction. Current studies of BIMs used for the operations phase and commercially available technologies focus on transferring information from the design and construction phases to the operations phase by enabling creation and capturing of digital facility information throughout the facility lifecycle. Some of the commercial systems provide automated transfer of such information from BIM to Computerized Maintenance and Management Systems (CMMS) and/or Computer Aided Facility Management (CAFM) Systems but the focus of recent studies is limited to automated transfer of space and asset data with some emphasis on gathering the manufacturer and maintenance schedule information. Hence, currently available facility management systems are not benefiting from the 3D visualization capabilities that BIMs provide and the topological relationships between components already available in them. In this paper, the authors discuss opportunities for utilizing BIMs for facilities management, with a specific emphasis on supporting maintenance planning. The envisioned approach does not only make use of the information in a BIM that is transferred from design and construction phases, but also leverages the spatial relationships represented in a BIM for visualization and analyses of facility data. Along with this vision, the authors present results of a case study in which work orders generated during a one year period for a campus building were investigated and manually integrated into a BIM of that building in order to assess possible benefits that might be gained through the usage of a BIM for maintenance planning. Some of these benefits include: trend analysis of breakdowns at certain locations and under certain topological relationships and analysis and visualization of spatial relationships of work orders for more effective reactive maintenance and preventive planning.},

   abstract = {Facility maintenance management (FMM) has become an important topic for research on the operation phase of the construction life cycle. Managing FMM effectively is extremely difficult owing to various factors and environments. One of the difficulties is the performance of 2D graphics when depicting maintenance service. Building information modeling (BIM) uses precise geometry and relevant data to support the maintenance service of facilities depicted in 3D object-oriented CAD. This paper proposes a new and practical methodology with application to FMM using BIM technology. Using BIM technology, this study proposes a BIM-based facility maintenance management (BIMFMM) system for maintenance staff in the operation and maintenance phase. The BIMFMM system is then applied in selected case study of a commercial building project in Taiwan to verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate its effectiveness in FMM practice. Using the BIMFMM system, maintenance staff can access and review 3D BIM models for updating related maintenance records in a digital format. Moreover, this study presents a generic system architecture and its implementation. The combined results demonstrate that a BIMFMM-like system can be an effective visual FMM tool. © 2013 Yu-Cheng Lin and Yu-Chih Su.},

   abstract = {The adoption of building information modeling (BIM) in the design and construction phases of building projects has increased considerably in recent years; however, its use in postconstruction is still lagging. Much of this is because of the lack of experience by owner organizations in using BIM during operations and maintenance (O&M). The architecture, engineering, construction, and operations (AECO) industry is undergoing a major paradigm shift that will require building owners to develop lifecycle-oriented BIM strategies. Consequently, owners will play a vital role in improving the maturity of future BIM-assisted projects through their requirements documentation, assessment of the quality and accuracy of BIM deliverables, and continued application of BIM during facilities management (FM). The primary objective of this research study was to develop a framework for building owner organizations to use in the assessment of their BIM competency. Using the Delphi technique, 66 critical factors that are influential in the evaluation of owners' BIM competency were identified and prioritized on the basis of the perceptions of 21 prequalified BIMexperts. The data derived from the Delphi phase were then used to propose an assessment tool that allows owners to evaluate their operations across three diverse competency areas and 12 specifically tailored competency categories. These evaluations can then be used by owners to assess and expand their technical knowledge, improve their current BIM requirements, and increase the efficiency of their postconstruction operations.

Although most owners agree on the potential benefits of integrating BIM technologies with facility management (FM), they must overcome many problems to plan and develop effective BIM execution plans for FM implementation. This study proposes and develops a BIM execution plan for BIM model management for FM during the pre-operation phase. Through the application of the proposed BIM execution plan, BIM can be effectively implemented during the operation and maintenance phases. In order to verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice, the BIM execution plan is then applied in a selected case study of a building project in Taiwan. The combined results demonstrate that the proposed BIM execution plan is an effective approach for operation and maintenance management. The advantage of the proposed BIM execution plan lies not only in improving the efficiency of maintenance management work when integrated with BIM technologies, but also in maximizing the value and benefits of BIM to support maintenance management. Finally, limitations, difficulties, and suggestions are summarized for further development of the BIM execution plan for BIM model management during the pre-operation phase.},

   abstract = {Despite BIM asset information management processes having advanced to globally recognised standards, facilities and asset integration remains problematic for many companies engaged in the construction project lifecycle. Challenges typically stem from deficiencies in the BIM regulations and standards, inaccurate information exchanges, software interoperability issues and unclear requirement definitions that ultimately result in higher project costs and poorer operational efficiencies. An exploration of these challenges and their potential solutions is therefore important if BIM-FM integration issues are to be improved. Few studies have systematically investigated this subject from the perspective of a BIM-accredited Mechanical and Electrical (M&E) company engaged on projects. This paper combines a literature review with an empirical case study of a BIM-accredited Mechanical and Electrical (M&E) contractor to explore the critical issues surrounding facilities and asset management integration; this combination of evidence providing a distillation of the issues surrounding BIM/FM asset integration and its' resolution. 15 key issues from the literature were classified under 4 broad themes (Informational, Technological, Organisational and Industrial) as being of primary concern; the case study analysis verifying the findings and also providing a series of bespoke recommendations for improving industry practice. The paper clarifies the problem issues (both negotiable and systemic) afflicting the industry, indicating how individual companies can develop their own processes for improving BIM-based asset integration. It may be concluded that although BIM asset integration processes have reached globally recognised standards, systemic characteristics of the industry result in persisting problems that impact the BIM-FM asset management journey.},

   abstract = {Building Information modeling (BIM) has the potential to advance and transform facilities Operation and Maintenance (O&M) by providing a platform for facility managers to retrieve, analyze, and process building information in a digitalized 3D environment. Currently, because of rapid developments in BIM, researchers and industry professionals need a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in facility O&M. This paper presents a review of recent publications on the topic. It aims to evaluate and summarize the current BIM-O&M research and application developments from a facility manager's point of view, analyze research trends, and identify research gaps and promising future research directions. The scope of this research includes the academic articles, industry reports and guidelines pertaining to using BIM to improve selected facility O&M activities, including maintenance and repair, emergency management, energy management, change/relocation management, and security. The content analysis results show that research on BIM for O&M is still in its early stage and most of the current research has focused on energy management. We have identified that the interoperability in the BIM-O&M context is still a challenge and adopting the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Framework is a potential starting point to address this issue. More studies involving surveys are needed to understand the underlying O&M principles for BIM implementation – data requirements, areas of inefficiencies, the process changes. In addition, more studies on the return on investment of the innovative systems are required to justify the value of BIM-O&M applications and an improved Life Cycle Cost Analysis method is critical for such justifications.},

   abstract = {The asset management phase of a building constitutes approximately 60% of its total lifecycle costs. However, significant unnecessary expenses occur in current asset management practices because of the separation of the design and construction phases from operation and maintenance and the lack of an effective building asset management system covering all types of buildings with numerous components. Asset management decision-making is inherently a process that requires the assimilation of a multitude of data, processes, and software systems. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated decision support system for building asset management that addresses the systematization and coordination of lifecycle data. In this approach, a lifecycle work breakdown structure (WBS) for the asset management system is developed to provide a unified hierarchy to categorize and organize building assets. It is then used to develop the WBS-based integrated building lifecycle asset management model through a relational database management system (DBMS). Since building information modelling (BIM) is a rich information-based platform with large volumes of asset data needed, it is integrated with the WBS-based DBMS to achieve an effective integrated building asset management. A case study of an educational building is presented and discussed in the paper to demonstrate how the proposed automated solution is used for asset management. The research contributes to the body of knowledge by formalizing a WBS-based unified asset inventory hierarchy and mapping BIM data to the proposed hierarchy for effective asset management.},

   abstract = {This article focuses on how to specify relevant information content in objects and object libraries in order to exchange relevant and reliable information in building information model (BIM)-based software. There is a general lack of professional information in BIM-based designs. The AECOO (architects, engineers, contractors, owners and operators) industry should therefore take the initiative to achieve a broad consensus about the specification of relevant information that should be standardized as content in the objects. Improved exchange of information in BIM-based software will support integrated design and delivery solutions. Objects/object libraries are proposed as the container for the exchange of information. Software objects (doors, windows, walls) and object libraries (selections of objects) with specified professional information (measurements, performance, energy, fire resistance, noise reduction, etc.) are called 'BIM objects'. The 'role-and life-cycle information model' (RIM/LIM) concept is suggested as a framework for development (specification) of relevant information in different roles and phases of a building's life cycle. A 'BIM object information standard' can be based on the RIM/LIM framework. Content in the BIM objects can be included as specifications in information delivery manuals and BIM guides. © 2010 Earthscan.},

   abstract = {Facilities management (FM) encompasses and requires multidisciplinary activities, and thus has extensive information require- ments. While some of these needs are addressed by several existing FM information systems, building information modeling (BIM), which is becoming widely adopted by the construction industry, holds undeveloped possibilities for providing and supporting FM practices with its functionalities of visualization, analysis, control, and so on. This paper explores how BIM can be a beneficial platform for supplementing FM practices. An online survey and face-to-face interviews were conducted to assess the current status of BIM implementations in FM, potential applications, and the level of interest in the utilization of BIM. Interactions between BIM and FM are defined by illustrating application areas and data requirements for BIM-enabled FM practices. Highlighting the synergy between the two, this paper can help professionals recognize potential areas in which BIM can be useful in FM practices.

We contribute to the discussion by analysing the Center for Properties and Facilities of the University of Helsinki. We ask (1) what kind of information tools for facility management the maintenance personnel use; (2) how the design data was handed over in the University’s central library project; and (3) how designers and facility managers find the possibilities of integrating BIM models and maintenance information systems. In the library project, the data was handed over and archived for potential later use. The information for the maintenance manual, however, was collected separately by an outside consultant. The designers thought that models should be simplified to meet the needs of the maintenance. The representatives of the Center did not see that uses of BIM models would provide a significant added value in relation to the potential provided by the maintenance information systems already in use. They found as a possible next step the transfer of some information from BIM models to their facility management and maintenance systems. A partial, stepwise integration of the systems seems to be a realistic way forward.},

Hence, they may be unable to develop their operational information requirements to request the right data from the design and construction phases. This paper investigates the operational information requirements of three asset owners through a comparative study. A qualitative multi-case study approach was used to collect and analyse the operational information requirements of three asset owners. A qualitative content analysis was also utilised to identify key asset information requirements and categories. The study revealed that operational information requirements are strongly related to business needs and that it is not possible to develop a rigid list of requirements for asset owners, but rather some templates to help them define their data requirements. Of a total of 172 analysed information requirements, only 7 requirements were common in all cases and 16 were common in 2 cases, which represents 4% and 9% of the total. The research addressed a significant research gap regarding the development of operational information requirements for asset owners. Moreover, the paper provides templates to help guide asset owners when defining their data requirements for asset operations in order to derive BIM business value.},

This confinement stresses the challenges associated with the lack and absence of reusing existing building facilities, as is domain knowledge. Within this scope, this paper proposes a novel approach for existing building facilities semantic-enrichment from indoor digital scanning portrayal phase to semantics depiction and management phase for renovation, rehabilitation, or restoration functions. In this paper, we present an ontological system, which relies on integrating the as-is information BIM and semantic web technology. The developed approach improves existing building facilities, as-is information formalization, and management for maintenance purposes. The paper outcome is a semantically integrated knowledge-based framework that can potentially: 1) constitute a semantic database for building facilities components as-is information using BIM; 2) overcome the lack and absence of retrieving and reusing building facilities as-is domain information; and (3) formalize the building facilities as-is knowledge in a computable way.},

Large owners such as universities often provide these detailed guidelines and deliverable requirements to their building teams. Investigation of the University of Southern California (USC) Facilities Management Service's (FMS) website showed a detailed plan including standards, file names, parameter lists, and other requirements of BIM data, which were specifically designated for facilities management use, as deliverables on new construction projects. Three critical details were also unearthed in the reading of these documents: Revit was the default BIM software; COBie was adapted to help meet facilities management goals; and EcoDomus provided a display of the collected data viewed through Navisworks. Published accounts about the Cinema Arts Complex developed with and under these guidelines reported positive results.

   abstract = {Projects in the construction industry typically involve complex information flows from early design, through construction, to facility management (FM). Building Information Modelling (BIM) tools and workflow processes are considered key enablers for collaboratively managing such information across phases of the project lifecycle. With the increased adoption of BIM by the construction industry, there are heightened expectations for increased engagement of facility managers (FMs), users and clients in the BIM process. This is based on the proposition that BIM can benefit the operational phase of a building, which contributes the most to the building lifecycle in terms of overall cost, sustainability and usability. The study aim was to investigate current levels of understanding and adoption of BIM by facility managers in practice. Three research questions were investigated: (a) How client and FM engagement with BIM workflows can be improved through early contemplation of their requirements; (b) what are the perceptions about BIM and its potential impact on the FM industry from an FM, user and client perspective and (c) what information is required by FM from the BIM process to maximum optimisation of assets in the operation phase. Mixed research methods, including: a literature review of academic and industry publications (e.g. case studies, industry best practice, standards and guidelines), an online survey of FM professionals and focus groups, were used to address the posed research questions. The findings highlight the need for further education regarding BIM guidelines and standards. In particular, new and more FM/client-focussed BIM strategy documents, EIR and other templates are required. Many existing templates (e.g. EIR) are not focused on client's needs. Guidance is required on developing BIM strategies based on understanding the client's Organisational Information Requirements (OIR) and Asset Information Requirements (AIR) in order to develop an EIR that specifies what, when and how information should be delivered. This will 2 improve timely decision making during design and ensure that the right and correctly structured information is delivered to clients at handover for their Asset Information Model (AIM) to help optimise the operation of their assets.

This debate has had renewed significance since the emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) processes and the proposition that BIM information, captured during the facilities lifecycle, can help improve the efficiency of Facility Management (FM). Using this proposition as a starting point, the overarching aim of this paper is to investigate the value-adding potential of BIM and the challenges hindering its exploitation in FM. The literature review showed the BIM value adding potential stems from improvement to current manual processes of information handover. It also adds improvement to the accuracy of FM data and increases the efficiency of work orders execution, in terms of speed, to accessing data and locating interventions. It was also revealed that there is lack of real world case studies, especially in the case of existing buildings, despite new constructions representing a small percentage of the total building stock in a typical year. The case study was conducted on an existing asset composed of 32 non-residential buildings in Northumbria University’s city campus. This was done to empirically investigate the value of BIM in a specific FM function (i.e. space management). The results provided evidence of the value of BIM in improving the efficiencies of FM work orders and the accuracy of geometric information records.},

Despite this, organisations struggle to view assets within the context of whole-life management and ultimately struggle to harness their full potential value. A recurring theme is the challenges in capturing, storing and validating data across a diverse and complex asset portfolio. The primary reason for this is the fundamental lack of understanding of what information should be collected to support the efficient management of assets throughout their life. Asset-related information that is not collected in alignment to the organisational requirements will restrict the performance of capital investment decisions, risk management and operational performance throughout the whole life of the asset portfolio and ultimately have an impact on productivity. This paper presents a top-down methodology that utilises Building Information Modelling to support the development of Asset Information Requirements. The novel aspect of this approach is the development of Functional Information Requirements to bridge the gap between organisational requirements and Asset Information Requirements.},

   abstract = {BIM for Facilities Management (BIM for FM) is a relatively new and growing topic of inquiry aiming to fulfil the informational needs of the operational phase of assets within increasingly digitalised project workflows. Research into the management of structured (i.e. graphical and non-graphical) and unstructured data (i.e. documents) has largely focused on design and construction phases. Information management in facilities management and maintenance is still challenged by the lack of a structured framework that can simultaneously fulfil these three capabilities: (1) the delivery of information models (i.e. Asset Information Models) from distributed data sources; (2) the validation of these information models against the requirements; and (3) the use of their information in facilities management (e.g. operation and maintenance). This research aims to develop and test a framework and a prototype Common Data Environment (CDE) to achieve these three capabilities. The framework and the developed CDE are entirely based on use open standards and integration of existing technologies. A requirements model, underpinning the framework and the CDE was developed during three iterative stages of interviews –in line with the adopted Grounded Theory and Design Science Research methodologies– with industry experts and through a three-stage coding process at each iteration. The framework and the CDE were tested in pilot demonstrations with a use case focused on preventive and reactive maintenance. The testing demonstrated that the implementation of ‘BIM for FM’ processes is feasible with the proposed framework and CDE relying entirely on open standards and existing technologies. Some additional requirements for BIM for FM processes were also identified during the verification sessions with industry and are proposed for future research.},

   abstract = {For a sustainable building, the use of energy always concerns clients and designers. In this respect, the UK national regulation on energy performance and ‘carbon’ accounting has asked for a greater consistency of construction information to achieve the CO2 emission target. Therefore, Clients and Industry should work closely together in developing plans to make the transition to low carbon buildings feasible in order to meet the CO2 emission target. In this context, Building Information Modelling (BIM) can play a key role in addition to its capability to create more homogenisation of the construction supply-chain. For the energy analysis packages, the designers usually receive feedback on their design; such as how much energy the building will use, what are the anticipated CO2 emissions and if the building will pass performance criteria (such as: LEED or BREEAM). BIM applications for energy analysis have been introduced to improve this process but mostly at the design stage. However, for the post-occupancy stage, there is a need for a proper and systematic methodology to monitor the behaviour of buildings and to make critical decisions to ensure that the energy criteria of the design are really met in practice. This paper introduces a conceptual BIM-based model that can improve the post-occupancy evaluation process and meet the industry requirements for sustainable buildings.},

   abstract = {Currently, the construction industry is turning towards sustainability. Nevertheless, in order to achieve a sustainable performance, a balance between environmental, social and economic criteria has to be created. There are already different tools available which have the potential to reach this goal. It is necessary to identify them as such and find out how they can be integrated to obtain synergies and contribute to sustainable construction. These tools have to be implemented in early design phases so as to add value to the project. In the present paper, two powerful methods, namely BIM and LCA, will be highlighted. Such methods can be of great assistance in the context of sustainability. On the one hand, BIM supports integrated design and improves information management and cooperation between the different stakeholders throughout the different project life-cycle phases. On the other hand, LCA is a suitable method for assessing environmental performance. Both LCA and BIM should be integrated in the decision-making process at an early stage with a view to achieving a holistic overview of the project, including environmental criteria, from the beginning.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as a suitable data analysis tool to overcome facility management (FM) benchmarking difficulties: FM performance benchmarking analysis is often unsophisticated, relying heavily on simple statistical representation, linking hard cost data with soft customer satisfaction data is often problematic. A case study is presented to show that DEA can provide FM personnel with an objective view on performance improvements. An objective of the case study is to investigate the relative efficiency of nine facilities with the same goals and to determine the most efficient facility. The case is limited to nine buildings in FM on four inputs and nine output criteria. The paper concludes by demonstrating that DEA-generated improvement targets can be applied when formulating FM outsourcing policies, strategies and improvements. Facility manager can apply DEA-generated improvement targets in formulating FM outsourcing policies, specifications development, FM strategy and planning. FM benchmarking with DEA can enhance continuous improvement in services' efficiency and cost saving. This will help reduce utility cost as well as pollution. This paper fills the gap in the research of FM benchmarking by applying DEA which studies both soft and hard data, simultaneously. It also contributes to a future research of a tradeoff sensitivity test between FM cost, services performance and reliability. © World Scientific Publishing Co. & Operational Research Society of Singapore.},

   abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore the current condition of the Big Data concept with its related barriers, drivers, opportunities and perceptions in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry with an emphasis on facilities management (FM). Design/methodology/approach: Following a comprehensive literature review, the Big Data concept was investigated through two scoping workshops with industry experts and academics. Findings: The value in data analytics and Big Data is perceived by the industry, yet the industry needs guidance and leadership. Also, the industry recognises the imbalance between data capturing and data analytics. Large IT vendors’ developing AEC industry-focused analytics solutions and better interoperability among different vendors are needed. The general concerns for Big Data analytics mostly apply to the AEC industry as well. Additionally, however, the industry suffers from a structural fragmentation for data integration with many small-sized companies operating in its supply chains. This paper also identifies a number of drivers, challenges and way-forwards that calls for future actions for Big Data in FM in the AEC industry. Originality/value: The nature of data in the business world has dramatically changed over the past 20 years. This phenomenon is often broadly dubbed as “Big Data” with its distinctive characteristics, opportunities and challenges. Some industries have already started to effectively exploit “Big Data” in their business operations. However, despite many perceived benefits, the AEC industry has been slow in discussing and adopting the Big Data concept. Empirical research efforts investigating Big Data for the AEC industry are also scarce. This paper aims at outlining the benefits, challenges and future directions (what to do) for Big Data in the AEC industry with an FM focus.},

   abstract = {The construction industry has worked towards embracing Building Information Model (BIM) innovations for improving the efficiency, accuracy and reliability nowadays. However, the implementation of BIM in building Operations & Maintenance (O&M) is still limited. Previous research only focused on identifying influential factors for the promotion of BIM use in building O&M without considering the systematic manner and the dynamic nature of technology evolution process. This study thus aims to establish an analytical activity system model (ASM) using the activity theory to analyze the BIM use in building O&M in a systematic and dynamic way. The ASMs (traditional and evolutionary) of two different statuses (i.e., without and with BIM-assisted O&M) and the corresponding evolution processes were established based on the critical process models with actors and activities identified in the 1st round interviews with 14 experts. Then, the contradictions as the drivers of evolution in the ASM from the traditional one to the evolutionary BIM-assisted O&M have been examined based on the 2nd round interviews involving the 14 experts and 32 questionnaire surveys. An ASM based driver model of evolution for the BIM-assisted O&M is finally constructed. 26 innovation-oriented internal drivers and six demand-oriented external drivers have been identified, and 21 recommended actions, with the context of social, political and technical influences, have been proposed correspondingly to enhance the identified drivers to achieve BIM-assisted O&M. These results provide a map for O&M practitioners, policy makers and researchers to promote the implementation of BIM in O&M, and are beneficial to the delivery of BIM in building O&M.},

This positioning paper responds to practical business needs of organisations and project teams, builds upon existing conceptual constructs, and delivers a modular information management framework. The Lifecycle Information Transformation and Exchange (LITE) framework is an extendable conceptual skeletal for defining, managing, and integrating project and asset information. Developed, described, and explained for ongoing field testing, the LITE framework integrates multiple components - information statuses, states, milestones, flows, gates, routes, loops, actions, sets, and tiers – which collectively lay the foundations for an open access digital platform being developed by an international Community of Research and Practice. The framework describes – and aims to predict - information flows across an asset's lifecycle. Its modular conceptual structure, iterative flows, and task-oriented terminology are calibrated to guide the integrated design, delivery, and utilisation of assets of any type, function, or scale.},

Development of a BIM and IoT-Based Smart Lighting Maintenance System Prototype for Universities' FM Sector. Buildings 2022, 12, 99. https://doi. Abstract: Reactive maintenance (RM) is a core service of the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, the most prolonged and costly within the building lifecycle. RM is characterised by inefficient asset information and communication management, impacting critical FM problems and users' experience. Building information modelling (BIM) and Internet of things (IoT) has enabled the development of digital twins, moving facilities management (FM) from a reactive approach towards a predictive one. Although previous studies have investigated the application of such technologies to FM, there is a lack of understanding on procedural issues related to its implementation in FM and RM. This research aimed to characterise strategies and decisions involved in prototyping a BIM and IoT-based smart-lighting maintenance system and identify its potential impacts on universities' maintenance processes. The adopted research strategy and data collection methods involved prototyping, questionnaires, and interviews. The results show a high level of complexity in converging maintenance needs and technological abilities for FM and the importance of procedures and standards at organisational and industry levels. Moreover, it evidenced that the automation of functions and the centralisation of information enabled by BIM and IoT can optimise service provision, generate environmental and efficiency gains, and improve users' safety and satisfaction.},

In this paper, we aim to study the expansion of the digital twin in including building life cycle management and explore the benefits and shortcomings of such implementation. In four rounds of experimentation, more than 25,000 sensor reading instances were collected, analyzed, and utilized to create and test a limited digital twin of an office building facade element.

Sustainability 2021, 13, 480. https://doi. Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations. Abstract: The EU Green Deal, beginning in 2019, promoted a roadmap for operating the transition to a sustainable EU economy by turning climate issues and environmental challenges into opportunities in all policy areas and making the transition fair and inclusive for all. Focusing on the built environment, the voluntary adoption of rating systems for sustainability assessment is growing, with an increasing market value, and is perceived as a social responsibility both by public administration and by private companies. This paper proposes a framework for shifting from a static sustainability assessment to a digital twin (DT)-based and Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled dynamic approach. This new approach allows for a real-time evaluation and control of a wide range of sustainability criteria with a user-centered point of view. A pilot building, namely, the eLUX lab cognitive building in the University of Brescia, was used to test the framework with some sample applications. The educational building accommodates the daily activities of the engineering students by constantly interacting with the sensorized asset monitoring indoor comfort and air quality conditions as well as the energy behavior of the building in order to optimize the trade-off with renewable energy production. The framework is the cornerstone of a methodology exploiting the digital twin approach to support the decision processes related to sustainability through the whole building's life cycle.},

   abstract = {Incomplete building information in delivery and the lack of compatible tools for Operation and Maintenance (O & M) have hindered the development of the intelligent management of Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) systems. In fact, the information related to the O & M management of the MEP system conventionally comes from the completion documents in the forms of hard copies or unstructured digital files, making it hard to search for useful information in the "sea" of documents and drawings. Therefore, digitalization of information is an urgent task to facilitate the intelligent management of the MEP system. As a project deliverable, the as-built information model shall not only contain geometrical information and necessary construction-related data, but also built-in information useful for the intelligent O & M management. In the present study, based on the Building Information Modeling/Model (BIM) technology, a set of solutions including the automatic establishment of the logic chain for MEP systems, an equipment grouping and labeling scheme and an algorithm to transform BIM information to GIS map model, is proposed to digitalize and integrate the MEP-related information into the as-built model. Subsequently , a cross-platform O & M management system is developed using the MEP-related information in the as-built model to run routine O & M tasks and to effectively response to MEP-related emergencies. The developed system is applied to aid the O & M management of MEP engineering in a real project, showing that the developed system facilitates the intelligent O & M management and guarantees the security of the MEP system and its subsystems.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {The low accessibility to the information regarding buildings current performances causes deep difficulties in planning appropriate interventions. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors make available a high quantity of data on energy consumptions and indoor conditions of an existing building that can drive the choice of energy retrofit interventions. Moreover, the current developments in the topic of the digital twin are leading the diffusion of Building Information Modeling (BIM) methods and tools that can provide valid support to manage all data and information for the retrofit process. This paper shows the aim and the findings of research focused on testing the integrated use of BIM methodology and IoT systems. A common data platform for the visualization of building indoor conditions (e.g., temperature, luminance etc.) and of energy consumption parameters was carried out. This platform, tested on a case study located in Italy, is developed with the integration of low-cost IoT sensors and the Revit model. To obtain a dynamic and automated exchange of data between the sensors and the BIM model, the Revit software was integrated with the Dynamo visual programming platform and with a specific Application Programming Interface (API). It is an easy and straightforward tool that can provide building managers with real-time data and information about the energy consumption and the indoor conditions of buildings, but also allows for viewing of the historical sensor data table and creating graphical historical sensor data. Furthermore, the BIM model allows the management of other useful information about the building, such as dimensional data, functions, characteristics of the components of the building, maintenance status etc., which are essential for a much more conscious, effective and accurate management of the building and for defining the most suitable retrofit scenarios.},

Currently, however, the BIM environment can integrate only basic static information. Expert knowledge information to guide the building activity process is lacking. Consequently, with the increasing complexity of building services, BIM has difficulty adapting to the needs of rapid collaboration in the building operation process. To solve this problem, first, we present the basic knowle-dge-embedded model. The model provides services for knowledge generation and knowledge embedding. Moreover, taking BIM-based fire emergency management as an example, the formal modelling and credibility verification of knowledge are adopted to standardize the knowledge generated from experts to reduce future input errors and interpretation. Second, to provide the capability of process knowledge representation in BIM, we embedded the knowledge of the fire emergency management process into BIM by extending the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard and providing a BIM knowledge extraction algorithm using the IFC standard, thereby extracting the control strategy from BIM to achieve the reasoning of knowledge. Finally, we prototyped BIM-Fire in a real building scenario and validated the effectiveness of the method. The automatic control of knowledge-driven BIM-based activities is realized.},

   abstract = {In a world where sustainability constantly manifests itself as the contemporaneous zeitgeist in practically every facade of our lives, it is imperative to understand the energy performances (EP) of buildings, both old and new, and explore innovative ways to optimise this cardinal aspect of building operation. In this light, we investigate the potential benefits of integrating Building Information Modelling (BIM) into EP analysis of built infrastructures. This research, in the form of a case study, has been designed to uncover equipments of high energy consumption in an Eco-Home, and subsequently to compare BIM-based simulations with the actual data measured on energy consumption. From the analysis, this study also proposes several recommendations on energy optimisation. For the purpose of EP analysis and simulation runs, Autodesk Green Building Studio (GBS) has been deployed, while 3D BIM Model of the Eco-Home was generated using Autodesk Revit. In situ energy audit revealed that the air-conditioner was the most energy-intensive equipment in the Eco-Home. Only a small variation of energy consumption was observed in actual and simulated data. Further analysis on design alternatives illustrated that the EP of the Eco-Home can be vastly improved by adopting a few measures, such as the installation of occupancy sensors to automate lighting, the integration of greywater reclamation system to reduce water consumption, and the addition of photovoltaic panels to increase renewable energy generation. However, from the same analysis, wind energy was found to be inviable due to its low level of energy potential. This paper concludes that integrating BIM and GBS into EP analysis not only improves the overall EP measurements, but also acts as an enabler for designers and building owners to compare design alternatives effectively. The advancement of BIM integration in this study offers an interesting proposition for the architectural , engineering, and construction industry especially when it comes to the enhancement of sustainability of a building.},

   abstract = {Reportedly, the application of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a collaborative methodology for the life-cycle management of a building has numerous benefits. Nevertheless, its adoption during the operational stage remains limited, and the New Zealand (NZ) built environment is no exception. The present study offers a prioritized list of barriers that are inhibiting industry-wide adoption of BIM during the facility management (FM) phase. Both BIM and FM contexts were first thoroughly reviewed to identify the potential barriers (26), which were then refined via semi-structured interviews with qualified experts representing industry and academia. The refined barriers (20) were then prioritized through a hybrid Parsimonious Fuzzy AHP approach. Despite the leadership of the decision-makers in promoting the use of BIM in all phases of the building life cycle, the cost-related barriers (both for BIM software/hardware and training) remain the most significant. Perhaps, as a result of this, lack of expertise and unfamiliarity with BIM associated technology is among the most inhibiting barriers, which also requires utmost attention. It can be concluded that the industry stakeholders need to commit additional resources to help overcome the barriers and enable a wider application of BIM for FM. Increased application of BIM for FM will have positive implications for the future of the FM industry and digital future of the built environment, which has been a national strategy. The results are believed to identify the most crucial barriers impeding technology supported change in FM practices.},

Then, according to these working conditions, the indoor design temperature is determined and the building energy consumption is simulated and analysed. It is concluded that when the indoor relative humidity increases from 30% to 50%, the temperature decreases from 24.3 °C to 15.5 °C, and the relative humidity decreases when the indoor temperature increases. According to the different assumptions of the value chain of the Grand Theatre, specific value chain management models of the Grand Theatre are established at macro and micro levels respectively. The establishment of the model enables the value chain theory to be implemented from the conceptual category to the specific operation and management optimization, and deepens the theoretical research on the competitive strategy of the Grand Theatre.},

   abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been extensively studied and applied within the AEC sector, particularly in design and construction. In recent years, Facility Management (FM) processes are becoming more digitalised, thus requiring effective BIM-FM integration. BIM adoption in many countries, such as the UK, Italy and Brazil, has been publicly driven. Generally, adoption was targeted at design and construction implementation, with little effort in framing public action for FM implementation. The lack of an integrated approach for BIM-FM implementation resulted in numerous bespoken implementation approaches that mimic the private sector and hinder knowledge exchange. Therefore, there is a need for assessing and amalgamating knowledge about BIM-FM for public organisations. This research aims to leverage knowledge about BIM-FM in the public domain by analysing and classifying articles published between 2010–2021. The research was carried out through a systematic review and comparative thematic analysis investigating the use of BIM for different public buildings (e.g., schools and hospitals) and the implementation for FM purposes. Research results outline prevalent trends and areas of research from three perspectives: people, process and technology. Results show an increasing number of publications about BIM-FM. However, the divide between BIM-FM for public and private organisations is unequal. BIM-FM research for public organisations is still limited and lacks standardisation. This state-of-the-art review makes an incremental contribution to knowledge by identifying progress, gaps and new industry directions on the subject matter.},

   abstract = {There are various information systems to improve organisational performance that are well-established in construction companies. However, information systems, especially in integrated management system, are not yet well-established to describe productivity of the worker in order to improve organisational performance. There is still needed development in the procedure and manual in this information system. These are developed by an integrated management system clause (high level structure). These procedure and manuals will reduce rework, accident, sickness and waste as part of an integrated management system in a construction company. Information systems are needed as a component of communication, sharing and exchanging information in an integrated management system in construction companies. This information system is used for the efficient implementation of integrated management system resources. An integrated management system is required to make the system more effective and efficient in supporting the company's business processes. The efficiency can be done by looking for any variables in an integrated management system that can increase organisational performance in a construction company through integrated information systems. This research's variables are based on previous research. Methodology used in this paper is literature review to describe database and model base in information systems. The result of this paper is a database and model base algorithm.},

It is necessary for researchers and practitioners to obtain a thorough view of the current status in the FM field and future development trends that have been summarized and discussed in depth. Using a bibliometric-qualitative analysis, a total of 724 academic journal papers on FM, between 1995 and 2018, were reviewed. A number of the latest advancements and emergent trends were identified based on knowledge maps in FM, including changing circumstances, enhancing information technology, all-around facility manager, strategic performance management, sustainable FM and innovative FM practice. It is hoped that this review can help researchers understand the current body of FM knowledge. The future directions were also highlighted in this study to help researchers identify areas where research is most needed. This study could also help practitioners to address upcoming challenges in the FM field.},

There is a need to establish an up-to-date synthesis on the current status of information exchange and interoperability between BIM and FM systems. After an in-depth review of 113 journal articles published from 2008 to 2018, this study systematically presents (1) a holistic review and critical reflection on the current status of BIM implementation in FM with a focus on information exchange and interoperability, (2) research trends and patterns and (3) research gaps and a future agenda in this area. Through a bibliometric and content review analysis, this paper concludes that the process of information exchange between BIM models and FM systems is not a straightforward process, as software interoperability remains a significant challenge. Bridging this gap requires standardized practical processes to integrate different information sources related to maintenance management, health & safety management tasks and BIM data, to provide a rich semantic database to support FM systems. Finally, it is hoped that this paper will advocate further developing a seamless information exchange process between BIM and FM systems to overcome interoperability issues and facilitate BIM implementation in FM.},

   abstract = {Facility managers usually conduct reactive maintenance or preventive maintenance strategies in building maintenance management. However, there are some limitations that reactive maintenance cannot prevent failure, and preventive maintenance cannot predict the future condition of MEP components and repair in advance to extend the lifetime of facilities. Therefore, this study aims to apply a predictive maintenance strategy with advanced technologies to overcome these limitations. Building information modeling (BIM) and Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to improve the efficiency of facility maintenance management (FMM). Despite the significant efforts that have been made to apply BIM and IoT to the architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) industry, BIM and IoT integration for FMM is still at an initial stage. In order to provide a better maintenance strategy for building facilities, a data-driven predictive maintenance planning framework based on BIM and IoT technologies for FMM was developed, consisting of an information layer and an application layer. Data collection and data integration among the BIM models, FM system, and IoT network are undertaken in the information layer, while the application layer contains four modules to achieve predictive maintenance, namely: (1) condition monitoring and fault alarming module, (2) condition assessment module, (3) condition prediction module, and (4) maintenance planning module. Machine learning algorithms, ANN and SVM, are used to predict the future condition of MEP components. Furthermore, the developed framework was applied in an illustrative example to validate the feasibility of the approach. The results show that the constantly updated data obtained from the information layer together with the machine learning algorithms in the application layer can efficiently predict the future condition of MEP components for maintenance planning.},

However, lack of data and information in as-built digital models considerably limits the potential of Building Information Modelling in Facility Management. Therefore, optimisation of data collection and management is needed, all the more so now that Industry 4.0 has widened the use of sensors into buildings and infrastructures. A literature review on the two main pillars of digitalisation in construction, Building Information Modelling and Internet of Things, is presented, along with a bibliographic analysis of two citations and abstracts databases focusing on the operations stage. The bibliographic research has been carried out using Web of Science and Scopus databases. The article is aimed at providing a detailed analysis of BIM-IoT integration for Facility Management (FM) process improvements. Issues, opportunities and areas where further research efforts are required are outlined. Finally, four key areas of further research development in FM management have been proposed, focusing on optimising data collection and management.},

Building information modeling offers a good opportunity to improve facility information management by providing a unified platform for various data sources rather than an intuitive information interface. Although current research trends reveal that there is a continuously growing interest in facility management aided by building information modeling, an integrated model is still hard to obtain. This paper aims at developing a novel methodology based on building information modeling and facility management systems integration, underpinned by a performance information model. The implementation process of a performance information model is described, including information technologies involved, the data and process requirements, and the building performance assessment methods used. A first pilot case-study has been conducted with regards to surgery rooms in healthcare buildings. The proposal can support condition-based maintenance work schedule, as well as the achievement of organizational, environmental, and technical requirements. Among the practical implications found: Improved technological and environmental performances assessment; better visualization of building condition; improved decision-making process; facilitated maintenance tasks planning and maintenance records management.

Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a two-phase approach. First, a thorough literature review was conducted to identify potential KPIs specific to the performance of laboratory facilities. This was followed by an assessment of the KPIs by 12 respondents including 6 professionals and 6 users. The KPIs were arranged in the form of a questionnaire survey containing response columns for agree/disagree, and importance rating scales for evaluation. The relative importance index values were also computed. Findings: The result of the study was a comprehensive list of 161 KPIs classified into nine categories including: space, access/circulation, utilities and waste, environmental conditions, furniture, appearance/finishes/image, communications, storage within the space and special building features. These KPIs were perceived to be at varying levels of importance by the respondents. Originality/value: Though previous studies developed KPIs for the performance of facilities, these KPIs are not universal. Thus, the originality of this study is in its identification of a comprehensive set of KPIs unique to the design, evaluation and management of research and academic laboratory facilities.},

   abstract = {The increasing digitalization and advancement in information communication technologies has greatly changed how humans interact with digital information. Nowadays, it is not sufficient to only display relevant data in production activities, as the enormous amount of data generated from smart devices can overwhelm operators without being fully utilized. Operators often require extensive knowledge of the machines in use to make informed decisions during processes such as maintenance and production. To enable novice operators to access such knowledge, it is important to reinvent the way of interacting with digitally enhanced smart devices. In this research, a mobile augmented reality remote monitoring system is proposed to help operators with low knowledge and experience level comprehend digital twin data of a device and interact with the device. It analyses both historic logs as well as real-time data through a cloud server and enriches 2D data with 3D models and animations in the 3D physical space. A cloud-based machine learning algorithm is applied to transform learned knowledge into live presentations on a mobile device for users to interact with. A scaled-down case study is conducted using a tower crane model to demonstrate the potential benefits as well as implications when the system is deployed in industrial environments.

Towards Cooperative Perception Services for ITS: Digital Twin in the Automotive Edge Cloud. Energies 2021, 14, 5930. Abstract: We demonstrate a working functional prototype of a cooperative perception system that maintains a real-time digital twin of the traffic environment, providing a more accurate and more reliable model than any of the participant subsystems-in this case, smart vehicles and infrastructure stations-would manage individually. The importance of such technology is that it can facilitate a spectrum of new derivative services, including cloud-assisted and cloud-controlled ADAS functions, dynamic map generation with analytics for traffic control and road infrastructure monitoring, a digital framework for operating vehicle testing grounds, logistics facilities, etc. In this paper, we constrain our discussion on the viability of the core concept and implement a system that provides a single service: the live visualization of our digital twin in a 3D simulation, which instantly and reliably matches the state of the real-world environment and showcases the advantages of real-time fusion of sensory data from various traffic participants. We envision this prototype system as part of a larger network of local information processing and integration nodes, i.e., the logically centralized digital twin is maintained in a physically distributed edge cloud.},

   abstract = {Instabilities and failure in many industrial structures can be too costly. That includes the pipeline structures for oil and gas industries or power generation plans and infrastructural transit systems. Prognostics and health management, along with Preventive, predictive, and prescriptive maintenance, are alternative options to avoid the failure in these systems by smart and on-time maintenance. However, although it is possible to collect data dynamically from these systems through their service periods, in many cases, a trustworthy and reliable knowledge base to allow making the right decisions is not always available. This paper presents the concept of LIVE Digital Twin that relies on four phases of Learn, Identify, Verify, Extend employing various Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) simulation strategies during the life span of the structure parallel to its design, performance, inspection, and maintenance. The architecture of LIVE Digital Twin is presented, and the details are described along with some practical case studies in Light Rail Transit (LRT) and pipeline systems in oil and gas industries. The presented concept and architecture of LIVE Digital Twin can be employed and implemented for various other applications and non-structural systems.},

This paper examines a recent survey of the experiences of facilities managers in the rapidly growing and evolving industry in regard to the barriers and their commitment to the sustainability agenda. The survey results show that time constraints, lack of knowledge and lack of senior management commitment are the main barriers for the implementation of consistent and comprehensive sustainable FM policy and practice. The paper concludes that the diversity of the FM role and the traditional undervaluation of the contribution it makes to the success of organisations are partially responsible for lack of success in achieving sustainable facilities. The overwhelming barrier for sustainable FM practice is the lack of understanding, focus and commitment of senior executives in appreciating the opportunities, threats and need for strategic leadership and direction in driving essential change, and hence further the sustainability agenda. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The case realized continuous, scheduled integration of static data and dynamic data of more than 20 management systems from the design, construction, pre-O&M phase up to the O&M phase. Then, a DT software system with real-time visual management and artificial intelligent diagnosis modules was developed and deployed in a newly built DT control center. Managers have the ability to grasp the detailed status of the whole hospital by visual management and receive timely facility diagnosis and operation suggestions that are automatically sent back from the digital building to reality. The case has been steadily running for more than a year in the hospital and achieved desired performance by reducing energy consumption, avoiding facility faults, reducing the number of requested repairs, and enhancing the quality of daily maintenance work.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Towards an Interoperable Approach for Modelling and Managing Smart Building Data: The Case of the CESI Smart Building Demonstrator. Buildings 2022, 12, 362. https:// Abstract: Buildings have a significant impact on energy consumption and carbon emissions. Smart buildings are deemed to play a crucial role in improving the energy performance of buildings and cities. Managing a smart building requires the modelling of data concerning smart systems and components. While there is a significant amount of research on optimising building energy using the smart building concept, there is a dearth of studies investigating the modelling and management of smart systems' data, which is the starting point for establishing the necessary digital environment for representing a smart building. This study aimed to develop and test a solution for modelling and managing smart building information using an industry foundation classes (IFCs)-based BIM process. A conceptual model expressed in the SysML language was proposed to define a smart building. Five BIM approaches were identified as potential 'prototypes' for representing and exchanging smart building information. The fidelity of each approach is checked through a BIM-based validation process using an open-source visualisation platform. The different prototypes were also assessed using a multi-criteria comparison method to identify the preferred approach for modelling and managing smart building information. The preferred approach was prototyped and tested in a use case focused on building energy consumption monitoring to evaluate its ability to manage and visualise the smart building data. The use case was applied in a real case study using a full-scale demonstrator, namely, the 'Nanterre 3' (N3) smart building located at the CESI campus in Paris-Nanterre. The findings demonstrated that an open BIM format in the form of IFCs could achieve adequate modelling of smart building data without information loss. Future extensions of the proposed approach were finally outlined.},

   abstract = {Featured Application: The proposed methodology has been developed to support the Asset Management (AM) decision making according to an open Building Information Modelling (openBIM) approach. Within the context of the West Cambridge Digital Twin Research Facility, a real case scenario has been considered, where the as-built data is imprecise or absent. The methodology is well suited to dealing with incomplete data on existing buildings, when the objective is integration among AM, the Internet of Things (IoT) and BIM information. Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) are powerful tools to support asset managers in the operation and maintenance of cognitive buildings. Building Information Models (BIM) are critical for Asset Management (AM), especially when used in conjunction with Internet of Things (IoT) and other asset data collected throughout a building's lifecycle. However, information contained within BIM models is usually outdated, inaccurate, and incomplete as a result of unclear geometric and semantic data modelling procedures during the building life cycle. The aim of this paper is to develop an openBIM methodology to support dynamic AM applications with limited as-built information availability. The workflow is based on the use of the IfcSharedFacilitiesElements schema for processing the geometric and semantic information of both existing and newly created Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) objects, supporting real-time data integration. The methodology is validated using the West Cambridge DT Research Facility data, demonstrating good potential in supporting an asset anomaly detection application. The proposed workflow increases the automation of the digital AM processes, thanks to the adoption of BIM-IoT integration tools and methods within the context of the development of a building DT.},

The research aims to integrate IoT alert systems with BIM models to moni-tor building facilities during the operational phase and to visualize building facilities’ conditions virtually. To provide efficient maintenance services for building facilities this research proposes an integration of a digital framework based on IoT and BIM platforms. Sensors applied in the building systems and IoT technology on a cloud platform with opensource tools and standards enable monitoring of real-time operation and detecting of different kinds of faults in case of malfunction or failure, therefore sending alerts to facility managers and operators. Proposed preventive maintenance methodology applied on a proof-of-concept heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) plant adopts open source IoT sensor networks. The results show that the integrated IoT and BIM dashboard framework and implemented building structures preventive maintenance methodology are applicable and promising. The automated system architecture of building facilities is intended to provide a reliable and practical tool for real-time data acquisition. Analysis and 3D visualization to support intelligent monitoring of the indoor condition in buildings will enable the facility managers to make faster and better decisions and to improve building facilities’ real time monitoring with fallouts on the maintenance timeliness.},

   abstract = {A Digital Twin (DT) refers to a digital replica of physical assets, processes and systems. DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create dynamic digital models that are able to learn and update the status of the physical counterpart from multiple sources. A DT, if equipped with appropriate algorithms will represent and predict future condition and performance of their physical counterparts. Current developments related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets. Most of these developments focus on the architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation & maintenance (O&M) phase, where the value potential is immense. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT is the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of assets. This paper presents a system architecture for developing dynamic DTs in building levels for integrating heterogeneous data sources, support intelligent data query, and provide smarter decision-making processes. This will further bridge the gaps between human relationships with buildings/regions via a more intelligent, visual and sustainable channels. This architecture is brought to life through the development of a dynamic DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge. Specifically, this demonstrator integrates an as-is multi-layered IFC Building Information Model (BIM), building management system data, space management data, real-time Internet of Things (IoTj-based sensor data, asset registry data, and an asset tagging platform. The demonstrator also includes two applications: (1) improving asset maintenance and asset tracking using Augmented Reality (AR); and (2) equipment failure prediction. The long-term goals of this demonstrator are also discussed in this paper.},

   abstract = {With the focus of smart construction project management, this paper presents a closed-loop digital twin framework under the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and data mining (DM) techniques. To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the high-fidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model. Consequently, tactic decision-making can realize to not only prevent possible failure in advance, but also arrange work and staffing reasonably to make the process adapt to changeable conditions. In short, the significance of this paper is to build a data-driven digital twin framework integrating with BIM, IoT, and data mining for advanced project management, which can facilitate data communication and exploration to better understand, predict, and optimize the physical construction operations. In future works, more complex cases with multiple data streams will be used to test the developed framework, and more detailed interpretations with the actual observations of construction activities will be given.},

   abstract = {The operation and maintenance of built assets is crucial for optimising their whole life cost and efficiency. Historically, however, there has been a general failure in the transfer information between the designand- construct (D&C) and operate-and-maintain (O&M) phases of the asset lifecycle. The recent steady uptake of digital technologies, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the D&C phase has been accompanied by an expectation that this would enable better transfer of information to those responsible for O&M. Progress has been slow, with practitioners being unsure as to how to incorporate BIM into their working practices. Three types of challenge are identified, related to communication, experience and technology. In examining the last aspect, it appears that a major problem has been that of interoperability between building information models and the many computer-aided facilities management (CAFM) systems in use. The successful and automatic transfer of information from a building model to an FM tool is, in theory, achievable through the medium of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema. However, this relies upon the authoring of the model in terms of how well its structure permits the identification of relevant objects, their relationships and attributes. The testing of over 100 anonymised building models revealed that very few did; prohibiting their straightforward mapping to the maintenance database we had selected for the test. An alternative, hybrid approach was developed using an opensource software toolkit to identify objects by their geometry as well as their classification, thus enabling their automatic transfer. In some cases, manual transfer proved necessary. The implications are that while these problems can be overcome on a case-by-case basis, interoperability between D&C and O&M systems will not become standard until it is accommodated by appropriate and informed authoring of building models.},

The paper describes the general methodology for the BMS definition, and method and results of first stages of the research. The preliminary analyses included Indicative Post-Occupancy Evaluations (POEs) supported by Building Information Modelling (BIM) to optimize sensor system planning. Test campaign are then performed to evaluate collected data quality and system efficiency. The method was applied on a Department of Politecnico di Milano. The period of the year in which tests are performed was critical for lighting conditions. In addition, spaces’ geometric features and user behavior caused major issues and faults in the system.},

The digital twin concept is gaining increasing popularity in architecture, engineering and construction/facility management (AEC/FM) sector, and a digital twin enabled asset condition monitoring and anomaly detection framework is proposed in this paper. A Bayesian change point detection methodology is tentatively embedded to reveal the suspicious asset anomalies in a real time manner. A demonstrator on cooling pumps is developed and implemented based on Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB) West Cambridge Digital Twin Pilot.

However, project delivery methods in the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry are often focused on the capital delivery stage and associated costs ranging from planning, through design, to construction and handover. Open data standards such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and specifications such as the Construction Operations Building information exchange (COBie) provide the capability to capture Facilities Management (FM) data requirements in a structured manner from the early stages of project development. We aim to investigate how and whether IFC and COBie can deliver the data and information about assets required by facility managers within a whole life cycle perspective. We focus on specific use cases including the creation of asset registers and service life planning. However, the methodology adopted can be generalised and applied to any other FM use case. The results show that IFC, COBie and the tested supporting tools exhibited some shortcomings in delivering some of the data entities, types and parameters required for the selected FM use cases. We discuss these shortcomings and propose them as areas for improvement to domain researchers, standardisation bodies and technology providers. Finally, we instigate domain researchers to adopt the proposed methodology and conduct further FM use cases.},

   abstract = {Construction clients'owners' demand is currently being recognised as a significant motivation and drive for the construction industry to begin to transform and adopt Building Information Modelling (BIM). In addition, clients can stimulate the innovation to achieve crucial benefits from BIM. However, the implementation of BIM is prevented from being more widely accepted across the construction industry by client fears and a lack of the full understanding of the benefits of BIM, as well as the requirements needed to realise these benefits. Therefore, it is important for client organisations to develop the required competencies that support the BIM implementation process and help to achieve the desired benefits of BIM. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to identify the critical success competencies that facilitate clients to fulfil their roles in the BIM implementation process. Multiple holistic case studies were used as the research strategy and semi-structured interviews were employed as the principal data collection technique. Code-based content analysis and cognitive mapping were used to analyse the verbatim interview transcripts. The data analysis process was facilitated by the computer-aided software, Nvivo. Several types of competencies are identified as critical success factors that enable client organisations to lead the BIM implementation process and increase the efficiency in BIM uses within the UK. In addition, it is concluded that by adopting these competencies, client organisations can enhance their Employer Information Requirements (EIR) and improve their ability to validate the outcome BIM models. These developments will increase client opportunities to meet their desired benefits. This paper provides a contribution to the body of knowledge by identifying BIM organisational maturity competencies for UK clients and their roles in the BIM implementation process, together with establishing the relationship between them. This will enhance the importance of the BIM maturity competencies within the BIM implementation from a clients' perspective. In addition, it will facilitate client organisations evaluating their ability to fulfil their roles through assessing the related competencies.},

The studies discussed in the paper cover a wide range of research from model-based information management to building information management, all the way to the interaction between buildings and smart cities.

Sci. 2021, 11, 4276. https://doi. Abstract: In the digital transformation era in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry, Cognitive Digital Twins (CDT) are introduced as part of the next level of process automation and control towards Construction 4.0. CDT incorporates cognitive abilities to detect complex and unpredictable actions and reason about dynamic process optimization strategies to support decision-making in building lifecycle management (BLM). Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding of the real impact of CDT integration, Machine Learning (ML), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT), all connected to self-learning hybrid models with proactive cognitive capabilities for different phases of the building asset lifecycle. This study investigates the applicability, interoperability, and integrability of an adapted model of CDT for BLM to identify and close this gap. Surveys of industry experts were performed focusing on life cycle-centric applicability, interoperability, and the CDT model's integration in practice besides decision support capabilities and AEC industry insights. The evaluation of the adapted model of CDT model support approaching the development of CDT for process optimization and decision-making purposes, as well as integrability enablers confirms progression towards Construction 4.0.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to examine and discuss the current patterns, gaps and trends in Digital Twin research in the architectural, engineering, construction, operation, and facility management (AECO-FM) industry and to propose future directions for industry stakeholders. A bibliometric search was performed on 197 papers that were obtained from the Scopus database. 151 of those papers were used in the subsequent scientometric analysis and mapping to narrate the evolution of the research subject. The studies discussed in the paper cover a wide range of research from model-based information management to building information management, all the way to the interaction between buildings and smart cities. The ‘virtual-physical building integration’, ‘building lifecycle management’, and ‘information integrated production’ subjects are highly in the focus of the research field. While ‘information-based predictive management’ and ‘virtual-based information utilization’ studies need to be addressed for a holistic Digital Twin adoption in the AECO-FM industry. Future studies should focus on the full integration of digital twin and its physical counterpart for better performance throughout the building life cycle. This study highlights the patterns, gaps and trends in Digital Twin research in the AECO-FM industry and contributes to the state-of-the-art digitalization and automation approaches in the construction project management body of knowledge. The sample size is a limitation for this research since it is relatively small due to the newness of the subject. Future studies may include data related to practice-oriented innovations and industry-initiated improvements to achieve broader and more informed results.},

   abstract = {Despite that the need to develop an integrated building information modeling-facility management (BIM-FM) system is often emphasized in the literature, real-life implementation case studies focusing on large-scale facilities are scarce. The goal of this paper is to describe the capacities of building information modeling (BIM) in the facility management (FM) phase by presenting the experience gained during the development and utilization of BIM-FM platform at a large-scale facility and to illustrate technical challenges and lessons learned from the perspective of practitioners. The selected case is an international airport facility, in which a BIM-FM platform was implemented and used in the FM phase for 4 years. Two data collection methods were used in the case study: (1) interviews with the project team; and (2) investigation of documents, models, and BIM-FM platform. The main contribution of this paper is that it provides qualitative insights on how BIM-FM integration was performed in a large-scale project, including BIM-FM platform selection and development processes, and identifying the technical challenges and lessons learned that were observed through the utilization and maintenance of a BIM-FM platform. The findings of the case study can be used by the practitioners to effectively adopt BIM in the FM phase, and by academics to understand the challenges and to develop related approaches.},

   abstract = {The emerging field of City Digital Twins has advanced in recent years with the help of digital infrastructure and technologies connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the evolution of this field has been so fast that a gap has opened in relation to systematic reviews of the relevant literature and the maturation of City Digital Twins on an urban scale. Our work bridges this gap by highlighting maturity in the field. We conducted a systematic literature review with bibliometric and content analysis of 41 selected papers published in Web of Science and Scopus databases, covering five areas: data types and sources, case studies, applied technologies and methods, maturity spectrum, and applications. Based on maturity indicators, the majority of the reviewed studies (90%) were at initial to medium stages of maturity (up to element 3), most of them focused on 3D modelling, monitoring and visualisation. However, digital twins cannot be limited to 3D models, monitoring and visualisation, for they can be developed to include two-directional interactions between humans and computers. Such a high level of maturity, which was not found in the reviewed studies, requires advanced technologies and methods such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, BIM and GIS. We also found that further studies are essential if the field is to handle the complex urban challenges of multidisciplinary digital twins. While City Digital Twins extend by definition beyond mere 3D city modelling, some studies involving 3D city models still refer to their subjects as City Digital Twins. Among the research gaps we identified, we’d like to highlight the need for near-real-time data analytics algorithms, which could furnish City Digital Twins with big data insights. Other opportunities include public participation capabilities to increase social collaboration, integrating BIM and GIS technologies and improving storage and computation infrastructure.},

Adopting BIM requires transforming the traditional building life cycle stages (planning, design, construction and facilities management) into BIM-integrated project deliveries. Assessing the BIM capabilities of these stages helps organisations to identify gaps in their BIM uses and improve them. There is a lack of a comprehensive model in the literature for assessing the BIM capabilities of individual building life cycle stages and their processes. Existing assessment models focus on assessing the BIM maturity of construction projects and organisations which do not inform the required BIM improvements for individual stages and their processes. Hence, we iteratively developed the Building Information Modelling (BIM) Capability Assessment REference Model (BIM-CAREM) and demonstrated its usability through multiple explanatory case studies performed with two international design and engineering companies and two general contractors in Turkey. We assessed the BIM capabilities of design, construction and facility management processes of various buildings i.e. residential, stadiums, hospitals and airports. The results showed that the BIM capability levels of design, construction and facility management processes vary within and across the companies.},

Predictive maintenance of building facilities requires continuously updated data on construction components to be acquired through integrated sensors. The main challenges in developing predictive maintenance tools for building facilities is IoT integration, IoT data visualization on the building 3D model and implementation of maintenance management system on the IoT and building information modeling (BIM). The current 3D building models do not fully interact with IoT building facilities data. Data integration in BIM is challenging. The research aims to integrate IoT alert systems with BIM models to moni-tor building facilities during the operational phase and to visualize building facilities’ conditions virtually. To provide efficient maintenance services for building facilities this research proposes an integration of a digital framework based on IoT and BIM platforms. Sensors applied in the building systems and IoT technology on a cloud platform with opensource tools and standards enable monitoring of real-time operation and detecting of different kinds of faults in case of malfunction or failure, therefore sending alerts to facility managers and operators. Proposed preventive maintenance methodology applied on a proof-of-concept heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) plant adopts open source IoT sensor networks. The results show that the integrated IoT and BIM dashboard framework and implemented building structures preventive maintenance methodology are applicable and promising. The automated system architecture of building facilities is intended to provide a reliable and practical tool for real-time data acquisition. Analysis and 3D visualization to support intelligent monitoring of the indoor condition in buildings will enable the facility managers to make faster and better decisions and to improve building facilities’ real time monitoring with fallouts on the maintenance timeliness.},

Nonetheless, a unique consensus about the digital transformation meaning in WDNs management is still missing. In this paper a recent paradigm for the digital transformation for WDNs is exposed and further extended, starting from the concept of Digital Twin for WDNs management. It encompasses the virtual representation of features and devices of the network integrated with advanced hydraulic modelling and Artificial Intelligence for supporting WDNs management tasks. The WDN Digital Twin is used within tools, named Digital Water Services (DWSs), working on GIS platforms. DWSs are conceived to support distinct phases of WDNs management by improving engineering awareness on technical decisions. Several DWSs, previously adopted for real WDNs management and planning, are here presented, as support tools for technicians and water utilities for achieving short-term and long-term management tasks.},

At the same time, the fruition of complex geospatial datasets (point clouds, Building Information Modelling (BIM) models, 2D and 3D models) on the web is still a challenge, because usually it involves the usage of different proprietary software solutions, and the input data need further simplification for computational effort reduction. Moreover, integrating geospatial datasets acquired in different ways with various sensors remains a challenge. An interesting question, in that respect, is how to integrate 3D information in a 3D GIS (Geographic Information System) environment and manage different scales of information in the same application. Integrating a multiscale level of information is currently the first step when it comes to digital twinning. It is needed to properly manage complex urban datasets in digital twins related to the management of the buildings (cadastral management, prevention of natural and anthropogenic hazards, structure monitoring, etc.). Therefore, the current research shows the development of a freely accessible 3D Web navigation model based on open-source technology that allows the visualization of heterogeneous complex geospatial datasets in the same virtual environment. This solution employs JavaScript libraries based on WebGL technology. The model is accessible through web browsers and does not need software installation from the user side. The case study is the new building of the University of Twente—Faculty of Geo-Information (ITC), located in Enschede (the Netherlands). The developed solution allows switching between heterogeneous datasets (point clouds, BIM, 2D and 3D models) at different scales and visualization (indoor first-person navigation, outdoor navigation, urban navigation). This solution could be employed by governmental stakeholders or the private sector to remotely visualize complex datasets on the web in a unique visualization, and take decisions only based on open-source solutions. Furthermore, this system can incorporate underground data or real-time sensor data from the IoT (Internet of Things) for digital twinning tasks.},

This project was motivated by a renewed interest from the city administrators towards the conservation of cultural heritage dating back to the Arab-Norman domination in Sicily since one of the two buildings was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list in 2015. The morpho-typological style of the churches has been acquired by high-detailed 3D surveys, which provided the base for two HBIM models suited to render the peculiarity of these buildings at their best. The BIM environment allowed both the geometrical representation of all the architectural elements and their further enrichment with the integration of non-geometric data and semantic signification through a knowledge-based workflow. This process led to a hierarchical organization of two high-accuracy digital replicas and to the creation of a database containing all of the architectural items typical of the Arab-Norman style, aimed to share the awareness of its conservation and to match all of the Cultural Heritage requirements. In the future, the features in this database can be shared with other specialists as reference objects for further studies on cultural heritage sites in the UNESCO list.},

   abstract = {A smart city digital twin refers to a system designed to digitally replicate real-world city objects in a virtual space and implement real-time synchronization with the real world, thus helping to solve urban problems through various service scenario simulations and data analysis processes. In relation to the development of city information models for implementing the smart city digital twin, many efforts have been made to integrate and utilize BIM-GIS data. However, due to problems with the capacity available for storing large amounts of data, there are limitations in practical applications because it is sometimes difficult to provide numerous realtime services in the era of web environments. Therefore, in this study, a lightweighting process for the Lightweight Digital Twin System was presented as a method to provide various services that a smart city offers based on the digital twin, and a lightweighting method was proposed accordingly. The process and method were verified through the development of a case application for the case of 00 city. It is expected that the Digital Twin System lightweighting method proposed in this study will serve as a basis for efficient city information processing and contribute to facilitating the provision of various smart city-related services.},

The study applied quantitative and qualitative approaches, with 1,520 teachers, consisting of 615 teachers from Islamic Schools (madrasah) in Bali and 905 in NTT. Findings indicate that the stress level experienced by madrasah teachers in the two provinces was in a low category at a score of 1.54, though both regions were at very different levels in terms of internet affordability, the highest cause of teacher stress was the concern for students’ ability to absorb the learning material; and 92.68% of teachers selected problem-focused coping mechanisms, particularly efforts to improve their skills in conducting distance learning. The findings from the study provide important input for teachers’s coping strategies for mental health issues of distance learning.},

   abstract = {This paper presents an indoor navigation support system based on the Building Information Models (BIM) paradigm. Although BIM is initially defined for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction/Facility Management (AEC/FM) industry, the authors believe that it can provide added value in this context. To this end, the authors will focus on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard for the formal representation of BIM. The approach followed in this paper will be based on the ifcOWL ontology, which translates the IFC schemas into Ontology Web Language (OWL). Several modifications of this ontology have been proposed, consisting of the inclusion of new items, SWRL rules and SQWRL searches. This way of expressing the elements of a building can be used to code information that is very useful for navigation, such as the location of elements related to the actions desired by the user. It is important to note that this design is intended to be used as a complement to other well-known tools and techniques for indoor navigation. The proposed modifications have been successfully tested in a variety of simulated and real scenarios. The main limitation of the proposal is the immense amount of information contained in the ifcOWL ontology, which causes difficulties involving its processing and the time necessary to perform operations on it. Those elements that are considered important have been selected, removing those that seem secondary to navigation. This procedure will result in a significant reduction in the storage and semantic processing of the information. Thus, for a system with 1000 individuals (in the ontological sense), the processing time is about 90 s. The authors regard this time as acceptable, since in most cases the tasks involved can be considered part of the system initialization, meaning they will only be executed once at the beginning of the process.},

Although progress has been made in various industry sectors such as aerospace, the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation (AECO) sector still requires further advancements, like the adoption of these technologies over traditional approaches. The use of these technologies should become standard practice rather than an advanced operation. This paper aims to address the existing gap by presenting a comprehensive framework that integrates technologies and concepts derived from purpose-driven case studies and research studies across different industries. The framework is designed to provide best practices for the AECO sector. Moreover, it aims to underscores the potential of DT for optimization through overseeing and digital management of the built environment across the entire life cycle of facilities, encompassing design, construction, operation, and maintenance. It is based on an extensive literature review and presents a holistic approach to outlining the roles of Building Information Modelling (BIM), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Internet of Things (IoT), and other key enablers within the DT environment.

The article discusses whether existing BIM formats are able to meet future requirements, where the potential in the construction industry to fully utilize semantic web technology is difficult with today's BIM standards. Furthermore, it is suggested that previously developed SW resources should be gathered, then earlier initiatives are easier to find, use and build upon. The literature study shows many initiatives spread across many domains in the AEC-FM area. Most studied articles have a high degree of technological focus, where the semantic web opportunities are tested in a chosen case.The findings of this study can be used as a starting point for further strategic research and development.},

To address this, this paper starts with a literature review of existing theories and practices of change management and digital transformation in the built environment sector. Based on the analysis of barriers and strategies identified in the literature review, a five-step roadmap for change management in BIM adoption is proposed. It includes establishing a change management team, conceptualizing the initiative, developing an implementation plan, managing the transition phase, and maintaining the change. The roadmap aims to guide organizations to effectively adopt BIM for FM, resulting in streamlined transition, enhanced operational efficiency, and improved asset performance. Further research is needed to validate the proposed roadmap and its potential for generalization to other sectors and countries.},

However, safety concerns in urban underground commercial buildings have become a major issue due to frequent accidents. Ensuring safe evacuation in densely populated underground commercial buildings is crucial. This study focuses on the safe evacuation of an urban underground commercial street A in Fuzhou City. A simulation framework based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) is proposed, integrating the Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS) and BIM. The framework overcomes limitations in fire dynamic simulators. Using a BIM model, the study analyzes the risk of each fire protection area and selects the most unfavorable area for simulation. PyroSim technology is employed to study the entire fire development process in the underground commercial street under three different fire scenarios. The analysis includes evacuation stair travel time and personnel available safe evacuation time (TASET). By comparing the results, the study optimizes building layout design and identifies factors affecting personnel evacuation efficiency. The simulation outcomes aim to minimize casualties and property losses, contributing to fire safety management in urban underground commercial streets.},

The crux of the AUREE project is a Web–GIS GeoBlog portal with customized semantic dashboards aimed at sharing information on an urban built environment and promoting the participation of local stakeholders in its improvement. As the latest development of this research, a workflow that integrates the AUREE portal with BIM authoring and an open-source IoT platform is implemented and applied to an experimental case study concerning a public building in Carbonia (Italy). The headquarters of the Sotacarbo Sustainable Energy Research Center was selected as the case study. The presented results proved that it was possible to create a valid open system, which was accessible to both specialist and unskilled users, and aimed at guiding, through a progressive knowledge deepening, common end-users toward proper conscious “energy behaviors” as well as public administrations and decision-makers toward sustainable facility management. Later, the proposed open system could also be suitable to be used as an effective tool to support the rising “energy communities”.},

Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a solution for enabling real-time data acquisition, transfer, analysis, and utilization for improved decision-making toward smart FM. Substantial research on DT for FM has been undertaken in the past decade. This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the literature on DT for FM. A total of 248 research articles are obtained from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. VOSviewer is then utilized to conduct bibliometric analysis and visualize keyword cooccurrence, citation, and co-authorship networks; furthermore, the research topics, authors, sources, and countries contributing to the use of DT for FM are identified. The findings show that the current research of DT in FM focuses on building information modeling-based FM, artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictive maintenance, real-time cyber–physical system data integration, and facility lifecycle asset management. Several areas, such as AI-based real-time asset prognostics and health management, virtual-based intelligent infrastructure monitoring, deep learning-aided continuous improvement of the FM systems, semantically rich data interoperability throughout the facility lifecycle, and autonomous control feedback, need to be further studied. This review contributes to the body of knowledge on digital transformation and smart FM by identifying the landscape, state-of-the-art research trends, and future needs with regard to DT in FM.},

   abstract = {In modern Smart City ecosystems, the wave of Big data has offered the potential for cities to obtain actionable insights from a large amount of data, collected from heterogeneous sources. To cope with data variety and to support querying facilities and navigation, domain experts, who possess the knowledge required to understand data sources structure and content, resort to the definition of metadata layers, for reconciling terminological differences and resolving ambiguity of data sources attributes. To this aim, the adoption of Semantic Web technologies assures a unified view of heterogeneous data sources and improves data access, leveraging open standards for knowledge representation. In this paper, we propose an approach to create a semantic data layer over Smart City data sources. The approach is grounded on two main pillars: (i) a procedure, to build and manage the semantic layer; (ii) a tool, implementing the steps of the procedure, devoted to support domain experts. Results of an experimentation conducted on representative Smart City data sources demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach. In particular, the presence in our approach of a preliminary step regarding lexical enrichment of data source attributes helped increasing the retrieval of useful concepts from domain ontologies for attribute annotation. In addition, allowing domain experts to provide additional ontological knowledge by specialising or creating new concepts and semantic relationships fostered flexibility in the annotation procedure, facilitating the evolution of the semantic layer. Finally, the developed semi-automatic tool helped domain experts in the semantic annotation process by also providing validation support.},

We have shown a dramatic increase in new cloud providers, applications, facilities, management systems, data, and so on in recent years, reaching a level of complexity that indicates the need for new technology to address such tremendous, shared, and heterogeneous services and resources. As a result, issues with portability, interoperability, security, selection, negotiation, discovery, and definition of cloud services and resources may arise. Semantic Technologies, which has enormous potential for cloud computing, is a vital way of re-examining these issues. This paper explores and examines the role of Semantic-Web Technology in the Cloud from a variety of sources. In addition, a "cloud-driven" mode of interaction illustrates how we can construct the semantic web and provide automated semantical annotations to web applications on a large scale by leveraging Cloud computing properties and advantages.},

   abstract = {Project development in the civil construction industry is changing as technologies and methodologies are introduced, such as BIM methodology. Among the phases of a building life cycle, the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase requires a set of information that must be gathered throughout the construction process. Usually, this information is recorded on paper, thus it makes it difficult to access and carry out maintenance activities. The BIM methodology facilitates the management sharing and digital storage of information that is generated throughout the phases of the building life cycle. However, the maintenance phase needs only part of this information. Although there are open standards, such as IFC, for data exchange between BIM models and maintenance software, it is still necessary to specify the information according to each element source of maintenance (ESM). Therefore, this work aims to propose a model of a maintenance sheet based on six main maintenance activities: inspection, cleaning, proactivity, correction, replacement, and conditions of use, starting from the division of the building in ESM, to facilitate the extraction of BIM model maintenance data.},

   abstract = {The paper introduces a real-time framework for selecting maintenance contractors to address building facility breakdowns promptly and cost-effectively. A faster and resource-efficient approach utilizing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method is proposed to achieve this. The method optimizes contractor selection by leveraging structured linked data and integrating maintenance into the Internet of Things (IoT) framework, reducing processing time. Implemented initially for elevator systems, this framework can be extended to other mechanical and electrical systems in buildings. It consists of three modules: the building's integrated data module, the application module, and the maintenance provider module. The first module integrates building databases through structured linked data, establishing a centralized information source. The second module employs mixed integer linear programming to select contractors based on cost, time, previous services quality score, and maintenance urgency. The third module facilitates communication between contractors and the building facility manager, enabling maintenance requests and offers. The MILP model considers budget and time constraints, as well as maintenance urgency to prioritize immediate maintenances. A case study demonstrates that this model offers a fast and effective information processing solution. The results indicate that the proposed framework significantly reduces decision-making time for facility managers, streamlining contractor selection. Furthermore, compared to conventional methods, this framework provides a more efficient and effective automated maintenance decision-making solution, thus making a valuable contribution to the field of building maintenance management.},

These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard for the construction industry defined through an EXPRESS schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference. Therefore, in this paper we will look into existing efforts in obtaining an ifcOWL ontology from the EXPRESS schemas of IFC and analyse which features would be required in a usable and recommendable ifcOWL ontology. In making this analysis, we present our implementations of an EXPRESS-to-OWL converter and the key features of the resulting ifcOWL ontology.},

The argument for such a semantic rule checking process has been made a number of times by now. However, there are a number of strategies and approaches that can be followed regarding the realization of such a rule checking process, even when limiting to the use of semantic web technologies. In this article, we compare three reference rule checking approaches that have been reported earlier for semantic rule checking in the domain of architecture, engineering and construction (AEC). Each of these approaches has its advantages and disadvantages. A criterion that is tremendously important to allow adoption and uptake of such semantic rule checking approaches, is performance. Hence, this article provides an overview of our collaborative test results in order to obtain a performance benchmark for these approaches. In addition to the benchmark, a documentation of the actual rule checking approaches is discussed. Furthermore, we give an indication of the main features and decisions that impact performance for each of these three approaches, so that system developers in the construction industry can make an informed choice when deciding for one of the documented rule checking approaches.},

   abstract = {Geometric data plays a central role in the geospatial domain, architectural design and construction industry. For upcoming, new approaches to store building data, such as the Semantic Web, no universal common agreement exists on the combination of geometric and non-geometric data. It can therefore be unclear to users on how to represent their geometries, leading to a decelerated application and advancement of making building data available over the web. This gap can only be bridged if a common approach on the representation of geometries on the web is achieved. To first generate a common understanding of geometry representations, an overview of existing and developing geometry (web) standards needs to be given and discussed, i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), CityGML, GeoSPARQL, and the OntoBREP and GEOM ontologies. This discussion needs to consider general contexts, e.g., 2D, 3D, detailed, or tessellated geometries, and specific use cases of the construction industry. Based on these discussions, this paper aims to propose a general recommendation for web-based geometry representations to enhance future applications of building data on the web. Due to the variety of use cases and their requirements, as well as technical constraints based on deviant interpretations of geometry descriptions from different geometry kernels, it became clear, that no approach or standard is generally superior to others. The biggest distinction identified in this paper is posed between the context of visualizing, where simplified, tessellated geometry holds the highest advantage, and (parametric) modeling, which requires semantically detailed geometry representations. Hence, we recommend to interlink non-geometric data with multiple geometry representations, to address all relevant contexts and use cases appropriately. The individual geometry representations should be chosen based on the relevant use cases for an optimal experience when using and exchanging geometry on the web. With this recommendation, the benefits of all discussed approaches can be exploited while avoiding their respective challenges.},

   abstract = {A construction project requires collaboration of several organizations such as owner, designer, contractor, and material supplier organizations. These organizations need to exchange information to enhance their teamwork. Understanding the information received from other organizations requires specialized human resources. Construction cost estimating is one of the processes that requires information from several sources including a building information model (BIM) created by designers, estimating assembly and work item information maintained by contractors, and construction material cost data provided by material suppliers. Currently, it is not easy to integrate the information necessary for cost estimating over the Internet. This paper discusses a new approach to construction cost estimating that uses Semantic Web technology. Semantic Web technology provides an infrastructure and a data modeling format that enables accessing, combining, and sharing information over the Internet in a machine processable format. The estimating approach presented in this paper relies on BIM, estimating knowledge, and construction material cost data expressed in a web ontology language. The approach presented in this paper makes the various sources of estimating data accessible as Simple Protocol and Resource Description Framework Query Language (SPARQL) endpoints or Semantic Web Services. We present an estimating application that integrates distributed information provided by project designers, contractors, and material suppliers for preparing cost estimates. The purpose of this paper is not to fully automate the estimating process but to streamline it by reducing human involvement in repetitive cost estimating activities.},

However, models simulating the occupants' perceived performance of indoor environments require highly heterogeneous input data. This paper aims to show how semantic web technologies can help to overcome problems deriving from this heterogeneity issue. Literature is studied to categorize the necessary input information for modeling occupants' perceived building performance. Two perspectives were consulted, namely the Indoor Environmental Quality approach and the Healing Environments approach. Based on the results, a core IEQ data model, integrating building topology, static properties, and dynamic properties, is proposed. We introduced a method to integrate this information by using the Building Performance Ontology (BOP). This method was tested by manually transforming the Open Smart Home (OSH) data to BOP vocabulary. Time-series data from various sensors were stored in InfluxDB and connected to the linked building data. A custom-built python tool was created to compute the thermal comfort of the OSH using the PMV/PPD method. The results indicate that a common data structure for static and dynamic properties helps to integrate the heterogeneity input data. Furthermore, we showed that adding occupants' data or system information could improve thermal comfort through multiple reactive approaches.},

   abstract = {Buildings in the operational phase have great potential for streamlining and simplifying processes related to unforeseen events. The availability and limitation of the necessary information for the roles involved are crucial to limit damage and inconvenience. These roles need to define their associated information need in an interplay. The standard ISO 19650 series describes recommended, comprehensive, and purpose-driven concepts and principles for business processes to support the management and production of information across the built environment. In an unforeseen critical event in the operational use phase, all involved participants, including the appointing party, have a short time to do repairs. The client should then be able to start the process using information contained in the asset management system. This study was initiated by several completed interdisciplinary user cases related to how ISO 19650 can be utilized to handle unforeseen events in the operational phase. The main results from the survey can be summarised as follows: 1) The process of clarifying which roles are involved is critical, 2) The “level of information needs” required of actors in the roles involved is critical, 3) Clarification of the necessary information is limited to what is needed for the role to be able to decide and thus continue the process, 4) There is identified a need for standardization in developing the information needs and the associated information flow. Based on a description of requirements for a defined asset information model (AIM), the surveys propose a simplified process description for requirements for information management related to unforeseen events. The study shows the importance of clearly specifying and delivering the required information but is still sufficient to solve the various roles tasks. At the same time, the need to develop “best practice” is revealed.},

   abstract = {With various emerging technologies and integration possibilities, smart facility management has gained wide interest in recent years. Several technologies were introduced to support facilities management and improve decision-making, such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), Digital Twin (DT), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain. Yet, facility managers still face challenges related to data handling and the actual implementation of these technologies. Thus, this paper explores the trends and integration possibilities of smart facilities management technologies to provide a deeper understanding of the current research state and the areas for future exploration. The Scopus database is utilized to collect literature data, and a bibliometric analysis is conducted on 7236 publications of different types, including conference publications, articles, reviews, and book chapters, using VOSviewer software. The results revealed a noticeable growth in the annual number of publications related to this field after 2018. BIM, IoT, and DT were seen to share the greatest research attention, with BIM being the dominant technology. With recent wide attention, blockchain technology is noticed to be introducing many integration possibilities. In addition, the prominent contributing authors, countries, and sources to this research area are also identified.},

   abstract = {An increasing number of information management and information exchange applications in construction industry is relying on semantic web technologies or tools from the Linked Open Data (LOD) domain to support data interoperability, flexible data exchange, distributed data management and the development of reusable tools. These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard for the construction industry defined through an EXPRESS schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference. Therefore, in this paper we will look into existing efforts in obtaining an ifcOWL ontology from the EXPRESS schemas of IFC and analyse which features would be required in a usable and recommendable ifcOWL ontology. In making this analysis, we present our implementations of an EXPRESS-to-OWL converter and the key features of the resulting ifcOWL ontology.},

   abstract = {At present, the capability to collect information from different sources [building information modeling (BIM), sensors, assets database] for asset management (AM) use has generated significant opportunities for asset owners and facility managers. BIM, in particular, is considered as a potentially effective data pool for storing and managing project information during the building life cycle, providing a common data environment for stakeholder data and guaranteeing information availability and credibility at the handover stage. However, this data integration in a BIM environment has issues related to the establishment of an effective process to extract, store, manage, integrate, and distribute data to ensure interoperability. Furthermore, for the interoperability issue, an important challenge is the identification of which data are relevant, reliable, useful, and can add value to the AM processes. This research explored the asset owner requirements from BIM in the operation and maintenance stage from an AM perspective. The research aim was twofold: first, to synthesize the nongeometric BIM data required for AM and develop a relevant taxonomy; and second, to develop an application programming interface (API) plug-in for Autodesk Revit to implement the proposed taxonomy. To achieve the aims of this study, a critical review of previous literature and face-to-face and focus group interviews with BIM and facilities management (FM) experts were conducted. The main output was a 60-parameter asset-consuming energy information management (ACE-IM) taxonomy and the relevant API plug-in that can help BIM professionals to identify the required data to be submitted to facility managers to improve AM processes.},

   abstract = {While progressing through the different stages of a project in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sector, a project must continuously comply with several requirements. Yet, human skills are often essential when it comes to validating these requirements, which can be error-prone and contributes to the loss of information in the information stream of a project. As has been indicated before, higher levels of automation can be achieved by describing, querying, and validating AEC project data using the technology stack offered by the Semantic Web (SW). Particularly the logical basis of these technologies (semantic rule-checking) is promising, as it allows a more consistent representation and checking of such requirements. As part of the development of a decentralized rule-checking system using SW open standards, this study investigates particularly to what extent the more challenging requirements can be checked, such as 3D geometric requirements and more ambiguous or vague requirements. Tangible and clear results described in this report are (1) a concise classification of rule types that apply to BIM models, (2) a system architecture for a semantic rule-checking system, and (3) a demonstration of this system through three use cases. The results show how 66% of a document containing human-readable requirements can be validated automatically. Furthermore, a clear indication is given of how the semantic compliance check can be combined with 3D geometric compliance checks into a scalable web-friendly architecture.},

   abstract = {The exchange of construction-related data over the Web via Semantic Web Technologies is gaining interest in current research. However, most research focuses on non-geometric data, neglecting the description of geometry. While several methods to include geometry descriptions into a Semantic Web context exist, no uniform approach or general recommendation exists for the endeavour of describing building components in their entirety – including geometric descriptions –, leading to an increased suspension in applying Semantic Web Technologies in the construction domain. To therefore ease the description of geometric data in a Semantic Web context, we conduct an extensive literature review and analyse the identified, oftentimes isolated implementations for geometry descriptions in that context, with focus on requirements set by domain-specific use cases. Based on this analysis, we group the currently available implementations into approaches and compare them to offer means for deciding on which approach or implementation suits individual use cases. The identified approaches vary in their depth of the geometry description's integration into the Semantic Web and are subsequently studied regarding their overall aptness and characteristics in consideration of their application for future industry and research projects. In respect of the ongoing research in the field of the application of Semantic Web Technologies, not only in the construction domain, this article poses as an important foundation by giving a clear overview of existing implementations and relevant open research questions. Having this overview, the suspense for adapting to Semantic Web methods for describing geometries can be overcome by users more easily, while software developers can start to connect their clients' use cases to suitable approaches and related implementations to represent geometry in a Semantic Web context.},

This paper conducts a bibliometric analysis of 122 papers from the perspective of data, model, and application to summarize the modes of IFC and ontology integration (IFCOI). This paper first analyzes the data and models of the integration from IFC data formats and ontology development models to the IfcOWL data model. Next, the application status is summed up from objective and phase dimensions, and four frequent applications with maturity are identified. Based on the aforementioned multi-dimensional analysis, three integration modes are summarized, taking into account various data interoperability requirements. Accordingly, ontology behaves as the representation of domain knowledge, an enrichment tool for IFC model semantics, and a linkage between IFC data and other heterogeneous data. Finally, this paper points out the challenges and opportunities for IFCOI in the data, domain ontology, and integration process and proposes a building lifecycle management model based on IFCOI.},

The emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered natural language interface (NLI) has a significant potential to provide a time- and cost-efficient way to extract partial subsets of Building Information Models (BIM). However, although the existing studies have demonstrated different methods to retrieve BIM models via natural language queries (NLQs), what aspects of model information and constraints are valuable and required to be retrieved by end-users using natural language (NL) has not been explored. To address this gap, this study conducts an information requirement analysis to understand the information needs of NLIs in querying BIM models. This research starts with a survey of the existing literature on BIM-oriented query languages and query systems. 102 sample query sentences from these studies are then extracted and analyzed. Next, the information entities, constraints, and question types in the collected sentences are manually identified, classified, and counted. The results reveal which aspects of BIM model subsets, constraints, and question forms are frequently mentioned in common BIM queries, which provide crucial guidance for the future development of AI-driven NLIs for information support in BIM-based construction projects.},

   abstract = {The growing adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) within the architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) sector raises questions about the quality of BIM data deliverables for project owners. Therefore, assessment and evaluation of such BIM data against relevant documents such as the BIM Execution Plan (BEP), the Level of Definition (LOD)/Level of Information (LOI) matrix, and quality control customized checklists become critical, especially in large construction projects. This study primarily aims to create an automated system for assessing the quality of 3D BIM model data, utilizing a proposed project quality control checklist. The automated system consists of four key elements: a BIM-based model, a Data Extraction and Analysis Module, a Data Storage Module, and a Data Visualization Module. The Data Extraction and Analysis Module extracts relevant information and parameters from BIM models to evaluate their quality against predefined checklists. Then, it transfers the information and stores the results in a database. The database is connected to an engineering project collaboration tool, ProjectWise, to automatically update and store the data in the cloud. The database is then connected to an interactive data visualization platform, Power BI, to enable automatic visualization of the generated quality assessment results of the BIM models’ data. This system was applied to a Canadian infrastructure construction project by its BIM department during the preliminary and detailed design phases. It demonstrated an average quality score (AQS) of 87.6% for the BIM models and significantly reduced failing items by around 30%. This study concludes that the system offers a robust, practical solution for enhancing the quality control process in BIM model data management, thereby aiding engineers in timely model adjustments to meet project requirements.},

Incorporating current information technology into city administration provides a path ahead, and the notion of digital twin cities appears as a possible alternative for effective urban planning.Objective: The core objective of this study is to describe the process of constructing city digital twins using modern information technology. Understanding and depicting the transition from essential Building Information Modeling (BIM) to sophisticated City Digital Twins (CDT) is required.Methods: A thorough six-IT-level pyramid is introduced to represent this progression. Beginning with BIM, the model proceeds to incorporate BIM-enabled GIS simulations, Internet of Things (IoT), integration of BIM with Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence, culminating at Level 6 as City Digital Twins. The possibility and technique for developing a CDT information system integrator are also considered.Results: The combination of the IT mentioned above creates comprehensive digital twins for specific buildings and urban areas. This helps with effectively maintaining these buildings and lays the way for the larger goal of smart cities to be realised.Conclusion: The current study highlights the need for a systematic, technology-driven approach to urban planning. The incorporation of sophisticated IT into city planning, namely the notion of City Digital Twins, emerges as a critical instrument in the design and administration of future smart cities.},

Experimental results demonstrate that this close-range linked data methodology effectively combines sensory data processing with RDF Graphs, thereby enabling more efficient resolution of construction process queries.

   abstract = {The evolution from Building Information Modelling (BIM) to Digital Twins (DT) marks a shift from static models to dynamic data-centric representations. Using DT can improve Infrastructure Operation and Maintenance (IOM) through prompt and comprehensive data, especially by providing services and value-added features. However, developing this service-oriented digital twin (SoDT) for IOM faces challenges due to data heterogeneity, fragmentation, and interoperability issues across various systems used by different asset authorities. This paper develops a service-oriented digital twin framework for IOM (SoDT-IOM), which focuses on multi-domain data integration and IOM service-oriented design. Service-oriented DT components and data integration mechanisms are developed, and an individual-multiple interacted data repository for IOM services is designed. Two-stage industrial interviews are conducted, and two use cases are illustrated to evaluate the functionality and efficacy of the framework. The evaluation results reveal that implementing a SoDT-IOM framework encounters challenges related to cost and data security; however, it is appreciated for its capacity to improve decision-making and collaboration with linked, accurate and timely data. This paper proposes further design requirements and implementation recommendations for SoDT of asset management from both technical and managerial perspectives.},

Unless the rate of building deterioration is checked, we are potentially allowing our physical assets to reach their ultimate functional life faster, while we face increasing user population, a constrained and decreasing maintenance budget and a slow growth in facilities provision. We are in a position to seriously consider the "real impact to improve the approach to management of physical assets of the University campus" and we need to develop appropriate management strategies to better manage and maintain our campus buildings and facilities. The use of additional management indicators that reflect its efficiency and effectiveness are also urgently needed. This study investigates the maintenance management practice in a main campus site, in a local University. The Maintenance and Repair Unit is supported by a maintenance information system, BEAM. In this investigation, we would like to know how the system has assisted in the management of maintenance and repairs. The issues addressed are: the maintenance strategies to be adopted and customer ownership. The data on civil, mechanical and electrical dockets from the BEAM system of the past two years, 1999-2000, were collected. We created the database in SPSS for windows and conducted statistical analysis. From our results, we have identified some areas for improvements: the classification system of building elements, and their nature of defects which could be utilised towards developing the maintenance strategies. We anticipate our research could be further developed to benefit other universities in the country.},

   abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) concept is used in different domains and industries, including the building industry, as it has physical and digital assets with the help of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Technologies and methodologies constantly enrich the building industry because the amount of data generated during different building stages is considerable and has a tremendous effect on the lifecycle of a building. Previous research underscores the importance of seamlessly exchanging information between physical and digital assets within a comprehensive framework, particularly emphasizing the integration of BIM data with various systems to enhance efficiency and prevent information loss. Despite advancements in technologies, challenges persist in optimizing methods for integrating BIM data into DT frameworks, including ensuring interoperability, scalability, and real-time monitor and control. This study addresses this research gap by proposing a comprehensive platform that integrates the DT concept with IoT and BIM technologies. The platform is developed in five main stages: 1) acquiring electronic data of the building from the laser scanner, 2) developing a Wi-Fi IoT module and BIM data for physical assets and digital replica, 3) constructing the DT elements of the platform, 4) performing data analysis 5) implementing thermal comfort prediction models. Two machine learning models (Facebook prophet, NeuralProphet) are implemented to predict thermal comfort. The best predictive model is identified by evaluating its error function using historical training data collected during facility operation. A case study demonstrates the practical application of the proposed framework. The case study involves a real building where the platform is implemented to monitor and control indoor environments. By utilizing predefined data in BIM models, the platform ensures data accuracy, consistency, and usability. The case outputs reveal that Neuralprophet provides good prediction results.},

RESTful Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of these domains allow easy access to the digital twin. While multiple information models are reasonable since the focus of these domains is distinct, interoperability becomes a challenge. Therefore, in this paper we propose a hypermedia-driven RESTful API for digital twins of the built environment. While the GIS and IoT interfaces are covered by established standards, we define a RESTful interface for Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models of the BIM domain. The APIs are interconnected with a federated approach though hypermedia navigation links. An evaluation by two use cases – a planning model and a structural health monitoring application – shows that the API can be used to navigate through the models crossing seamlessly the scope of the domains and overcoming barriers of interoperability.},

To cope with this high complexity, large amounts of data must be processed and exchanged throughout the whole life cycle of these systems. Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Semantic Web Technologies (SWT) offer the possibility to structure and link this data as well as to define common terminology. Semantic Web ontologies describing HVAC systems in the AECO industry have been developed, but an ontology for an integrated representation based on general system theory is missing. Therefore, this study proposes the TUBES System Ontology (TSO) as a knowledge representation for an integrated, explicit representation of linked technical systems, their hierarchical subdivision, structural and functional interconnections, and relationships to spatial entities. The contribution is validated on two example models, and the results are critically discussed, pointing out corresponding limitations as well as the need for further research.},

   abstract = {Despite its rapid development in the last decade, facilities management (FM) stills suffers from an identity crisis as the definition and scope of FM remains a contentious issue. To this end, three fundamental issues are re-examined in this paper: what FM constitutes; what a facility manager is; and how the FM profession can be enhanced. These issues remain critical as they represent the building blocks of the FM discipline. Without a common platform, the development of FM is likely to be fragmented. An evaluation of the definitions of FM provided in the past suggests that the focus of FM is clearly on the workplace. The key issues confronting FM are the location, type, quantity, quality, content and allocation of the workspace. A professional facilities manager is one who is formally trained and whose main responsibility is the strategic management of the workplace. Three factors are suggested to be important for the development of FM as a professional discipline. They include a clear role and scope of FM in the industry and firm, contribution to the bottom-line of the firm, and development of specialist knowledge and toolbox for addressing the problems of strategic workplace management. Some potential areas for theoretical developments have been suggested in this paper. © 2001, MCB UP Limited},

   abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is undeniably the most important trend in the digitization of the construction sector in recent years. BIM models currently being built are extremely geometrically rich, that is, they are modeled at a high level of detail in terms of geometry. Thanks to object-oriented programming paradigms, BIM models include high-level relationships to ensure interactions between objects, rapid view generation, and documentation. However, these models are not always equally rich in non-graphical data. This is true for parameters at the library object level, with which building object models are saturated, but also at the project, site, building, or floor levels according to the structure of the interoperable industry foundation classes (IFC) format. The current state of knowledge also lacks a clear methodology for inputting such data. For this reason, experimental work was undertaken on semantic enrichment in non-graphical data of a public building (a public kindergarten, Secemin, Poland), which has its BIM model at a high level of geometric detail but is poor in non-graphical data. As a result of the research and development work, all levels of the IFC structure were saturated with non-graphical data and validated, and the possibilities of their use were shown from the perspective of the facility manager. Documentation from the manager was used to achieve this goal, and selected analyses and simulations were performed on the enriched model. This article contributes to the discussion on semantic enrichment from CAD3D to BIM by presenting a detailed process for entering non-graphical data into a BIM model. The presented data entry method can be used by both modelers and facility managers. Thus, this paper fills an important research gap related to semantic enrichment in non-graphical data at different levels of the IFC structure.},

   abstract = {Building Information Models (BIMs) and City Information Models (CIMs) have flourished in building and urban studies independently over the past decade. Semantic enrichment is an indispensable process that adds new semantics such as geometric, non-geometric, and topological information into existing BIMs or CIMs to enable multidisciplinary applications in fields such as construction management, geoinformatics, and urban planning. These two paths are now coming to a juncture for integration and juxtaposition. However, a critical review of the semantic enrichment of BIM and CIM is missing in the literature. This research aims to probe into semantic enrichment by comparing its similarities and differences between BIM and CIM over a ten-year time span. The research methods include establishing a uniform conceptual model, and sourcing and analyzing 44 pertinent cases in the literature. The findings plot the terminologies, methods, scopes, and trends for the semantic enrichment approaches in the two domains. With the increasing availability of data sources, algorithms, and computing power, they cross the border to enter each other's domain. Future research will likely gain new momentums from the demands of value-added applications, development of remote sensing devices, intelligent data processing algorithms, interoperability between BIM and CIM software platforms, and emerging technologies such as big data analytics.},

   abstract = {While considered a relatively emergent area of research (Bloch and Sacks in Autom Constr 91:256–272, 2018), Semantic Enrichment (SE) and Semantic Web services are among the prominent topics and trends in BIM research (BIM handbook a guide to building information modeling for owners, designers, engineers, contractors, and facility managers, John Wiley & Sons Inc, New Jersey). SE computational approaches provide valuable means to overcome current BIM limitations such as interoperability, topology relationships, extensions to standard schemas, among many others. Therefore, the study herein consists of a semi-systematic literature review on BIM-based SE systems and applications developed during the last decade. The article describes the computational methods and approaches identified, a classification of the screened papers according to their primary BIM Use (https://bim.psu.edu/uses/), as well as reported limitations and recommendations for future developments. From the selected articles, main developments in SE techniques encompass multidisciplinary approaches comprising the use of Semantic Web technologies; inference rules, and rule processing engines; artificial intelligence methods; ontology mapping and semantic similarity; application of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) libraries; and custom plugins. Considering BIM Uses, research was mostly focused on "Capture Existing Conditions" and "Validate Code Compliance". Other identified BIM Uses " verified three or fewer occurrences. Reported limitations state that more user-friendly interfaces are required to handle SPARQL queries (Lee et al. in Autom Constr 68:102–113, 2016). Moreover, the ontologies development process is deemed as time-consuming (Zhong et al. in Build Environ 141:127–142, 2018), and constraints were identified when trying to share semantic data between BIM and Geographic Information System (GIS) platforms (Zhong et al. in Build Environ 141:127–142, 2018). Future research may be expected in transitions to a more extended BIM paradigm, such as the formalization of Digital Twinning processes; discussions concerning a standard format for SPARQL query results (Karan and Irizarry in Autom Constr 53:1–12, 2015); as well as enhanced support through the transition to Linked Data and ontology-based systems.},

An approach for generating the as-built BIM, geometric reconstruction of detected damage point clusters and semantic-enrichment of the corresponding IFC model is presented. Multiview-classification is used and evaluated for the detection of spalling damage features. The semantic enrichment of as-built IFC models is based on injecting classified and reconstructed damage clusters back into the as-built IFC, thus generating an accurate as-is IFC model compliant to the BMS inspection requirements.},

It is necessary to conduct SE for BIM according to the requirements of specific domains. There is still a lack of in-depth analysis and summary of the content, methods, and applications of SE for BIM in different stages during the life cycle of facilities, therefore this paper gives a comprehensive review of SE for BIM to analyze the status quo and trends from content, methods, and applications. The content and four methods of SE for BIM are summarized. The pros, cons, and applicability of each method are analyzed. Applications of SE for BIM in the life cycle of facilities are discussed comprehensively.

The current approach towards BIM models is still not matured in representing the progress of a construction since the model does not suit the order of construction. This project presents a new approach that involves creating a sub-object level 4D BIM model in a construction management perspective. By integrating detailed time scheduling with sub-object level 3D models, the approach aims to enhance daily progress visualization and communication solutions, improving the accuracy and reliability of BIM models. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, a 4D BIM simulation for a residential building was created and case studies and experiments were conducted. Advanced technologies such as scan vs BIM and augmented reality were used to perform the experiments. In summary, this project proposes a novel sub-object level 4D BIM modelling approach for construction progress monitoring.},

   abstract = {Building Energy Models (BEM) are widely utilized throughout all stages of a building's lifecycle to understand and enhance energy usage. However, creating these models demands significant effort, particularly for larger buildings or those with complex HVAC systems. While a substantial amount of information can be extracted from Building Information Models (BIM) — which are increasingly accessible and provide necessary data for geometric and HVAC contexts — this information is not readily usable in setting up BEM and typically requires manual translation. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a BIM-to-BEM (BIM2BEM) framework that focuses on automating the generation of HVAC parts of BEM models from BIM data. Core to the methodology is the extraction of HVAC system topologies from the BIM model and the creation of a knowledge graph with the HVAC topology. The topology transformation unfolds in three key stages: first, a geometry-induced knowledge graph is established by examining the geometric relationships among HVAC elements; second, this graph is converted into an informative HVAC topology with enhanced properties from additional data sources; and finally, the informative topology is simplified into a BEM-oriented HVAC topology compliant with BEM platforms such as EnergyPlus. A case study of a large university building with a complex HVAC system showcases that the proposed framework achieves automatic and precise generation of building performance simulation models. The model's predictions are then validated against actual measurements from the building.},

   abstract = {This research seeks to advance the technological process of 3D digitization in built environments and streamline management processes in the construction sector through digital methodologies. To this end, an integration framework is proposed that combines geographic information systems (GISs) and building information modeling (BIM) digital models, specifically for simulating building facilities maintenance management. Although the proposed methodology is applicable across various geographical contexts and building typologies, to ensure clarity in its development, it was applied to a specific case study. For this purpose, a 3D GIS model was created for one of the campuses of the University of Cantabria in Santander, Spain, along with a BIM model for one of its university buildings. Using these integrated models, facility management was simulated within a 3D environment via a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). The findings indicated that GIS and BIM digital models could indeed be integrated through straightforward linking mechanisms without compromising the efficiency of information synchronization and management. When comparing 2D facility management approaches with 3D formats, the advantages of 3D visualization became clear. This three-dimensional representation allowed for a more intuitive understanding of spatial dynamics and interactions, facilitating quicker identification of potential issues and more efficient maintenance operations. Consequently, integrating these advanced digital models not only optimizes operational efficiency but also fosters a collaborative environment, fundamentally transforming building facilities management.},

   abstract = {Methods to assess the performance of a building have been developed for decades, however, many buildings still do not satisfy their occupants in their indoor comfort preferences. This paper presents methods to generate insights from semantic digital twins on the perceived comfort levels of individuals to tighten the as-designed and as-perceived building performance gap. This paper first reviews existing personal indoor comfort models and shares state-of-the-art semantic web technologies in this domain. The paper then presents a generic framework to integrate heterogeneous data into knowledge graphs and use them in data mining processes. This framework is then applied to a case study in the Vertigo building in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. A wide range of information is collected, including building information models, indoor and outdoor sensor data, personal information, and feedback on indoor environmental quality. The integrated data are then used to create personal comfort models. First, multinomial logistic regression models are used to predict future dissatisfaction, after which a latent class analysis created cohorts of people with similar indoor comfort preferences. The results are stored back into the knowledge graph, after which they could be used in other applications, such as to perform occupant-centric control of systems. The methods presented in this paper are summarized in a generic framework that can be used and extended to other domains that aim to combine data integration and data mining.},
